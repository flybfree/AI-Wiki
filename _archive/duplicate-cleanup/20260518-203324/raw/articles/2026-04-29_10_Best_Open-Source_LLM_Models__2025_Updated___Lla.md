How to Choose the Right Open-Source LLM
Selecting the best model involves a trade-off between performance, cost, and practicality. Follow this 3-step decision flow.
Assess Your Budget and Hardware:
This is the first filter.
Consumer GPU (e.g., 24GB VRAM):
You are limited to models like DeepSeek-V2, Gemma 2 (27B), or quantized versions of 30-40B models.
Pro/Enterprise GPU (e.g., 48-80GB VRAM):
You can comfortably run 70B models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen2 72B.
Cloud/API:
If you have no local hardware, your choice is determined by your budget for API calls or managed hosting.
Define Your Primary Task:
General Chat/Reasoning:
Llama 3.1, Mixtral 8x22B, and DeepSeek-V2 are top contenders.
Coding:
DeepSeek Coder V2 is the specialist. Qwen2.5 is also a strong choice.
Long-Context RAG:
Qwen2 (72B) or Llama 3.1 (with its 128k window) are excellent.
Multilingual:
Qwen models have a distinct advantage.
On-Device/Edge:
Gemma 2 (9B) or smaller quantized models are the way to go.
Check Your License Needs:
Maximum Flexibility (Commercial Use):
Prioritize Apache 2.0 (Mixtral, Grok-1) or MIT licenses.
Standard Commercial Use:
Llama 3.1, DeepSeek, and Gemma licenses are generally safe but require reviewing their acceptable use policies.
Research/Non-Commercial:
Models with licenses like CC-BY-NC (Command R+) are only suitable for non-commercial projects.
Deployment Quick Starts
Getting started is easier than ever. Here are a few one-liners.

Benchmarks You Can Trust (and How to Read Them)
While no single benchmark is perfect, looking at a few in combination provides a strong signal.
Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard
:
A widely cited benchmark that tests reasoning, common sense, and knowledge across multiple standardized tests.
LMSys Chatbot Arena
:
A human-preference leaderboard where models are ranked based on anonymous, head-to-head user votes. It's excellent for gauging conversational ability.
Artificial Analysis
:
Provides detailed performance and cost comparisons for models served via major API providers.
Hallucination & Factuality Checks:
Look for consensus across
TruthfulQA
,
a hallucination leaderboard
, and FActScore for long-form. For RAG, require Ragas faithfulness to pass before shipping.
How to Interpret Scores
Be a critical consumer of benchmarks.
Look for Consensus:
A model that ranks highly on both the Open LLM Leaderboard and the Chatbot Arena is likely a top performer.
Beware of Contamination:
Some models may have been inadvertently trained on benchmark questions ("test leakage"), inflating their scores.
Human Preference Matters:
For user-facing chatbots, the Chatbot Arena is often a better predictor of real-world performance than academic benchmarks.
FAQ
What is the difference between open weights and open source?
"Open source" typically means both the model weights and the source code (training, inference) are available under a permissive license like Apache 2.0 or MIT. "Open weights" means the model weights are public, but they might be governed by a more restrictive custom license that dictates how they can be used, modified, or monetized.
Which models run on a single 24 GB or 48 GB GPU?
24 GB GPU (e.g., RTX 3090/4090):
You can comfortably run 4-bit quantized versions of models up to ~40B parameters. DeepSeek-V2 (21B active), Qwen2.5 (32B), and Gemma 2 (27B) are excellent choices.
48 GB GPU (e.g., A100 40GB, RTX 6000 Ada):
You can run 4-bit quantized versions of 70B-72B models like Llama 3.1 70B and Qwen2 72B.
Which models are best for 1M context or more?
While models like Llama 3.1 now have 128k context, Qwen models have historically been leaders in very long context. Some fine-tuned versions of Qwen models have demonstrated capabilities up to 1-2 million tokens, but these often require specific inference techniques. For most use cases, the 128k context offered by top models is more than sufficient.
Can I fine-tune commercially on each license?
For permissive licenses like Apache 2.0 and MIT, yes, without issue. For custom licenses like Llama 3.1, Gemma, and DeepSeek, the answer is also yes. The main restriction is that you cannot use models with a "Non-Commercial" (NC) license, such as Command R+'s default license, to create a commercial product. Always read the full license text.

Your use of the term “open source” is confusing. At the very least you should mention that none of these models are compliant with the OSI definition of open source models since they do not provide training data.
