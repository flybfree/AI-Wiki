Today, we are releasing Inkling-Small, an efficient open-weights model that achieves comparable performance to
Inkling
at a quarter of its size.
Inkling-Small is a Mixture-of-Experts transformer with 276B total parameters, 12B active, trained on NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems. Like Inkling, it features native reasoning over audio and images, variable thinking effort, a context window of up to 1M tokens, and well-rounded performance across a range of benchmarks.

Parameter comparison between Inkling-Small and Inkling.
Compared to Inkling, Inkling-Small achieves comparable performance with much less compute. Across agentic tool use (Terminal-Bench 2.1), reasoning (HLE text-only, no tools), and instruction following (IFBench) benchmarks, Inkling-Small is more efficient than Inkling and competitive with other models in its weight class. Furthermore, its
variable thinking effort
lets users easily adapt it to target their use case, balancing cost and performance.

Performance-Cost Comparison. Sweeping
reasoning effort
from
minimal to xhigh
traces the performance-cost curve (dollar output price per sample) for Inkling-Small and Inkling on Terminal-Bench 2.1, HLE (no tool), and IFBench. We show that Inkling-Small is competitive with other open-weights models in a similar size range on both performance and efficiency. Estimated output cost per sample is computed as mean generated tokens per sample × output price per token, where generated-token counts include reasoning tokens and come from our evaluations or public reports from
Artificial Analysis
(reasoning + answer tokens only). Inkling output pricing is $4.05 / 1M tokens and Inkling-Small output pricing is $1.20 / 1M tokens; for comparison-model pricing, we use the model provider’s official pricing when possible. When this is not possible, we use pricing from the recommended third party inference provider or pricing from Artificial Analysis, whichever is lower.
We are releasing the
full weights
of Inkling-Small. We’re also making it available for fine-tuning on Tinker, and for text, image, and audio chat on
Tinker Playground
.
Capabilities
As we build our model family, we are always iterating on our approach. Inkling-Small began training after its larger counterpart, which let us improve its training process. For example, we made changes to Inkling-Small’s pre-training data mix and machine learning recipe. Additionally, we post-trained an earlier checkpoint,
Inkling-Small (preview)
, in part using on-policy distillation with Inkling as the teacher. Starting from that checkpoint, we continued scaling agentic coding RL for two weeks. With these improvements, Inkling-Small surpassed Inkling on reasoning and agentic coding benchmarks. Inkling maintains an advantage on knowledge coverage and factuality.

Inkling-Small is a broad, balanced generalist model. Benchmark scores are shown on a shared 0–100 scale; higher is better.
Reasoning and Agentic Tasks
Inkling-Small matches or exceeds Inkling on reasoning and agentic tasks. On Humanity’s Last Exam it scores 31.6%, ahead of Inkling’s 29.7%, and the advantage holds at every thinking budget: Inkling-Small’s test-time compute curves sit above Inkling’s throughout. On SWEBench-Verified it exceeds 80%.
Across many reasoning and agentic benchmarks, Inkling-Small at max reasoning effort has a strong performance-token tradeoff when compared to open weights models in its weight class.

Token-Efficiency Performance Tradeoff on Reasoning + Agentic Benchmarks. We evaluate Inkling-Small and Inkling (with max effort) along with other open-weights models on agentic and reasoning tasks (GDPval-AA v2, τ³-Banking, AA-Briefcase and CritPt) and show performance and output token length (including reasoning + answer). Inkling-Small is among the most efficient open weights models, marked by the dashed line. Results were obtained from our evaluation or reference data from Artificial Analysis.
Inkling-Small also runs smoothly across a variety of coding and agent harnesses, making it a cost-efficient choice for coding and tool-use workflows.
Multimodality
Like Inkling, we crafted Inkling-Small for audio intelligence, making it a good candidate for real-world audio applications. We also improved its ability to use Python for visual tasks. The model can combine visual reasoning with operations such as cropping, zooming, and programmatic image inspection, improving usability on documents and charts where relevant information may be small or difficult to inspect directly.
Inkling-Small uses the same natively multimodal encoder-free architecture as Inkling. Audio is represented as dMel spectrograms, while images are divided into 40×40-pixel patches and transformed using a four-layer hMLP. Both are transformed via a light-weight embedding layer and processed jointly with text tokens. Inkling-Small nearly matches Inkling across most multimodal evaluations at a lower cost. It retains strong performance on visual reasoning, chart and diagram understanding, mathematical visual question answering, speech understanding, and longer-form audio reasoning.

Epistemics
Inkling-Small was trained similarly to Inkling on epistemics, focusing on calibration, instruction following, and resistance to censorship. Inkling-Small matches Inkling’s performance on forecasting. Calibration involved RL against proper scoring rules on a large corpus of real-world forecasting questions, improving its ability to express appropriate confidence and produce calibrated forecasts under uncertainty.

Safety
Inkling-Small inherited the same safety post-training recipe as Inkling, with built-in safeguards covering our internal spec of safety. These include everyday human-AI interactions as well as dual-use capabilities. Inkling-Small also underwent the same pre-deployment testing process, comprising both internal evaluations and red-teaming by trusted external partners.
On StrongREJECT, which measures whether models refuse unambiguously harmful requests, Inkling-Small is on par with Inkling, and matches the performance of existing open-weights models. On FORTRESS, which measures safety in settings spanning crime, violence, and dual-use risks, it is competitive in both refusal and over-refusal.

Inkling-Small against open- and closed-weights models across the full eval suite. Activated and total parameters are given for scale; a dash means the score was not available at the time of writing.
*SWEBench Verified:
Inkling and Inkling-Small’s numbers are reported using a bash-only harness. We use self-reported numbers for external models.
*Terminal Bench 2.1:
Inkling and Inkling-Small’s numbers are reported using an internal coding harness. A small number of solutions were found to be contaminated from web search and were assigned a score of 0. We use self-reported numbers for external models where available. Otherwise, we report performance using our internal harness.
†Audio MC:
Other models were evaluated internally since they are not on the official leaderboard.
†VoiceBench:
VoiceBench uses rule-based, hard-coded string matching for grading, making the evaluation sensitive to output-formatting differences. We therefore added a system message instructing models to follow the expected answer format.
†HLE with tools:
We benchmarked Minimax M2.7, Claude 4.5 Haiku, Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite, and GPT 5.6 Luna using our internal harness.
Try Inkling-Small on Tinker
Tinker customers have seen firsthand that the right fine-tuned model can outperform closed models on a variety of tasks, and do so faster and cheaper. We believe Inkling-Small’s combination of broad performance and efficiency will make it easy to experiment with and test in real applications, and we’re excited to see what developers build with it.
Inkling and Inkling-Small are available on Tinker with a limited-time discount and can be chatted with on the
Tinker Playground
using text, image, and audio. All other models on Tinker and checkpoints are also now available on Tinker Playground, billed at the rates listed on our
pricing page
.
Inkling-Small was made in pursuit of
our mission
to build AI that extends human will and judgment. It’s a capable and efficient model, and an important stepping stone for us as we continue our work.
