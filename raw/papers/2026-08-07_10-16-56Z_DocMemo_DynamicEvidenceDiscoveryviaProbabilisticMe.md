# DocMemo: Dynamic Evidence Discovery via Probabilistic Memory-Guided Retrieval for Multi-Modal Document Understanding

## Abstract
Long-document understanding requires locating sparse and heterogeneous evidence across hundreds of pages, yet existing systems remain limited by static retrieval and fragile cross-round memory. Mainstream single-round methods commit to a fixed top-$k$ page set at the outset and struggle to recover from early retrieval errors; recent iterative approaches allow multi-round evidence acquisition, but they do not investigate the propagation mechanism of cross-round states, making it difficult to track the dynamic changes in page relevance. To address these limitations, we propose DocMemo, a memory-guided framework that formulates long-document reasoning as dynamic evidence exploration. DocMemo maintains a tri-level retrieval state consisting of Document Schema Memory, Page Belief Memory, and Question Episodic Memory, which respectively capture structural priors, dynamic relevance estimation, and query-specific reasoning trajectories. During reasoning, DocMemo continuously refines cross-round page selection through Bayesian page belief updating with Thompson sampling, spatial proximity propagation, and structure-aware adaptive-granularity evidence access, while supplementing page-level evidence with fine-grained visual regions. Experiments on 3 benchmarks show that DocMemo achieves state-of-the-art performance and validate the efficacy of structured memory and dynamic page belief updating.
