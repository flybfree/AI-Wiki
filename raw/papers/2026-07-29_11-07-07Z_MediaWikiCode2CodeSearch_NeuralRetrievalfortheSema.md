# MediaWiki Code2Code Search: Neural Retrieval for the Semantic Discovery of Open-Source Software Entities

## Abstract
Code search in large-scale ecosystems is often hindered by the lexical gap between user queries and implementation details, alongside the trade-off between the low latency of traditional Information Retrieval (IR) and the precision of Deep Learning (DL). We present MediaWiki Code2Code Search, a neural retrieval system for semantic code-to-code discovery. By indexing 1.29 million structural entities (functions, types, and templates) across 2,500+ MediaWiki repositories, our system enables retrieval based on computational intent rather than surface tokens. We employ a split-build architecture, decoupling GPU-intensive offline indexing from a CPU-only serving layer; our FAISS IVF-PQ index occupies 168.6 MB: a 96.6\% reduction compared to a flat float32 baseline, and achieves a median query latency of 1.85 seconds on commodity hardware, satisfying the 6 GiB RAM constraint of Wikimedia Toolforge. Our evaluation across a 27-query benchmark demonstrates superior performance over the BM25 baseline, achieving a P@10 of 0.87 compared to 0.64 (0.52 versus 0.34 for strict matching). Gains are most pronounced in name-obfuscated tasks where lexical methods fail. The system is available at https://code2codesearch.toolforge.org under the Apache 2.0 licence and provides an open RESTful API.
