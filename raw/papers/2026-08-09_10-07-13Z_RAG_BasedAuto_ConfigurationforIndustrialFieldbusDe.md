# RAG-Based Auto-Configuration for Industrial Fieldbus Devices

## Abstract
Industrial device commissioning requires engineers to manually extract hundreds of protocol-specific parameters from heterogeneous PDF manuals and transcribe them into supervisory control systems, a time-intensive, error-prone workflow. This paper presents SysName, a production-oriented pipeline that automates device configuration end-to-end for Modbus RTU, OPC-UA, Profibus DP, and CANopen. It builds a hybrid dense-sparse retrieval index augmented by an ontology graph derived from ECLASS, AAS, and SOSA/SSN, using a BGE-M3 encoder with a cross-encoder reranker to surface relevant manual passages. A local LLM (T=0.1) generates ontology-aligned JSON-LD configurations via protocol-specific prompts and a four-step repair pipeline. A two-stage abstention gate, combining a reranker-score threshold and an IRI resolution ratio, blocks unsafe LLM invocations and filters low-coverage configurations before SHACL validation. On a gold set of 28 field-level queries, the hybrid retriever reaches 0.96 HitRate@10, and the reranker raises MRR@10 from 0.56 to 0.63 with perfect score separation for abstention. The generator attains field-level F1=0.87 with exact match on 9 of 12 runs. End-to-end runs on an H100 GPU complete in 2.6-6.6s per device with zero unsafe writes and zero silent failures on a five-device benchmark; every unsuccessful run is flagged by abstention or deployment verification. Component-wise evaluation localises the single systematic failure to OPC-UA generation, invisible to end-to-end metrics alone. A case study commissions a physics-simulated Universal Robots UR5e robot from unmodified vendor documentation (254-page manual, 8-page register list, 496 chunks), reaching field-level F1=1.0 over three runs with read-back and joint-consistency verification. An ablation study and comparison with five industrial-LLM systems complete the analysis.
