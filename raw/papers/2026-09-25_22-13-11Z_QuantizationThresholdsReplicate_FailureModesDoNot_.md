# Quantization Thresholds Replicate, Failure Modes Do Not: A Three-Model Study of Agentic Tool Use in Polish from 8-bit to 2-bit

## Abstract
We ask how GGUF quantization affects agentic tool use in Polish and whether the effects generalize across models. We introduce PolAgentBench, a deterministic benchmark with Polish prompts and English tool schemas: a 67-task main suite (15 adversarial probes, 52 hard-tier tasks) and a 46-task arithmetic isolation ladder. Three models span two axes of variation: Bielik-11B-v3.0 and its pruned, distilled child Bielik-Minitron-7B-v3.0 isolate model compression, and Llama-PLLuM-8B adds a change of pretraining family. Each is measured at six precisions, Q8_0 to Q2_K. Only the collapse threshold replicates. (1) All three models fall off a cliff between 3-bit and 2-bit (11B 0.716 to 0.045, 7B 0.463 to 0.149, PLLuM 0.224 to 0.015; paired McNemar p < 0.001 in each), across a fourfold capability spread and both axes. (2) Failure modes do not replicate: at 2-bit the 7B fails long (median 9.1k tokens, 4 steps) while the 11B mostly answers at the first step with a confabulated final answer (37 of 64 failures); PLLuM fails on content across precisions (71.8-92.0% of steps parse). (3) On the arithmetic ladder the unscaffolded rung is a floor, left standing by a rerun that states the no-tool rule; four explicit calls lift the 8-bit 11B from 1/10 to 9/10 and the 7B from 0/10 to 7/10 after format-only failures with the gold value are forgiven, an exploratory effect with eight distinct baseline inputs that does not survive multiplicity correction, while the order-trap arm separates the models at 8-bit (11B 6/6, 7B 0/6). (4) The Polish-versus-English gap is associated with degradation or with task family. We document four artifacts that shaped our conclusions (rounding-hostile gold values, strict answer typing, a no-tool rule the prompt never stated, priority-ordered failure labels), report affected results in strict and corrected form, and release the benchmark, trajectories and commit-stamped artifacts.
