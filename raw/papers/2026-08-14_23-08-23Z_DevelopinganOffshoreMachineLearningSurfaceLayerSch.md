# Developing an Offshore Machine Learning Surface Layer Scheme

## Abstract
Turbulent fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere are typically parameterized using empirically fit relationships. Here we test machine learning techniques for fitting the relationship for the offshore environment. To do that, data from three offshore sites are used: the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory (MVCO) air-sea interaction tower, the FINO1 research platform, and the CASPER-West FLIP research vessel deployed off the coast of California. Two machine learning methods were employed: Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forests (RF). Because the observational sites had towers with measurements at different levels, the vertical differences were input as gradients. Models were built for both momentum flux and heat flux. ML models trained at the individual sites were competitive with and in some cases, better than the physically-based COARE-3 model tailored to offshore fluxes. The heat flux ML models generally outperformed the physics-based parameterizations for most metrics, but the results were mixed for momentum flux, with only the site with the most training data (MVCO) producing results better than COARE-3. When the ML models from that site were applied to the other sites, results were degraded from using data from the site being tested. ML models built from data combined from the three sites generally showed improvements for the sites with less available training data. When assessing which variables were most important, the wind speed was most important for momentum flux and temperature gradient for heat flux.
