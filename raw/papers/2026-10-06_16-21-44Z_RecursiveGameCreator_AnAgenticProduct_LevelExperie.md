# Recursive Game Creator: An Agentic Product-Level Experience-Oriented Game Harness

## Abstract
Recent game design agents have made substantial progress in generating playable games. However, program correctness does not ensure an enjoyable experience for players. We present Recursive Game Creator, an experience-oriented harness to advance agentic game development from rough game prototypes into entertaining games. Recursive Game Creator organizes recursive development around four components: Designer, Builder, Player, and Reviewer. The Designer translates user instructions and Reviewer's feedback into detailed plans. The Builder turns these plans into candidate games. The coding-native Player creates and executes reusable policies through programmatic interfaces to efficiently collect diverse gameplay trajectories, mitigating evaluation bias caused by slow GUI-based collection. The Reviewer uses carefully designed trajectory-based metrics to induce player preferences, integrating with visual evidence and explicit textual preferences to evaluate games against game-specific criteria. Finally, the Reviewer accepts the better version and provides improvement reviews for the next round, closing the recursive loop. Our method achieves state-of-the-art overall performance of 77.89 on GameCraft-Bench. On GameASG-Bench, it achieves a strict task success rate of 53.2%, a 34.1% improvement over the same-model baseline, and the highest mean runtime-check pass rate at 93.4% among compared methods. A user study shows longer playtime and higher ratings. Code is coming soon.
