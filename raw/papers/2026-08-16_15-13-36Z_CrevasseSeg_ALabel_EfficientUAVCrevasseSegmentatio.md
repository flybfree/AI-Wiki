# CrevasseSeg: A Label-Efficient UAV Crevasse Segmentation Framework

## Abstract
Crevasse mapping from uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery matters for glaciological research and for field safety in glaciated terrain. Yet, pixel-level annotation of glacier surfaces is costly and requires domain experts. We introduce CrevasseSeg, a framework for binary segmentation over the terminus of Borebreen, Svalbard, comprising 1,938 unlabelled UAV orthomosaic tiles for self-supervised/unsupervised fine-tuning, 24 labelled tiles for validation and 176 labelled tiles for testing. Using CrevasseSeg, we benchmark five self-supervised objectives -- BYOL, a Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) objective, Barlow-Twins, VICReg, and a combined BYOL-JSD objective -- across three architectures: O-Net, O-Net++, and a DINOv3-initialised O-Net. Each configuration is evaluated under two frozen-feature readouts that differ only in the form of their decision boundary: a linear probe and a non-linear XGBoost classifier fit only on the 24 labelled validation images. Our central finding is a consistent inversion between the two readouts: DINOv3 features are the weakest under linear probing but the strongest under a non-linear readout. A UMAP analysis of the learned feature space shows that DINOv3 fragments pixels into many small clusters in which the classes are locally interleaved, whereas the convolutional architectures (O-Net and O-Net++) embed them onto a single class-sorted manifold. Satellite-pretrained DINOv3 improves over natural-image initialisation across objectives, and our label-efficient DINOv3-ViT-L-Sat-O-Net-BYOL-JSD pipeline reaches 75.33 mDSC / 61.28 mIoU, outperforming standard machine learning baselines fit on the same 24 labelled images with the RGB pixel values used as features. We release CrevasseSeg to support label-efficient segmentation research in remote sensing.
