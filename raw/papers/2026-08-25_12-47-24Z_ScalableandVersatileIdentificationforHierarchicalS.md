# Scalable and Versatile Identification for Hierarchical Structural Causal Models: A New Look at Project STAR

## Abstract
The STAR (Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio) experiment (1985, Tennessee, USA) is a landmark hierarchical dataset designed to assess the impact of class size on student outcomes, with observations nested within classes. To encode class-level interventions in such hierarchical settings, we develop a complete, scalable, open-source pipeline for Hierarchical Structural Causal Models (HSCM) that bridges symbolic identification and practical estimation. Our approach integrates graph transformations, pyAgrum's do-calculus for automatic identification of causal effects, adaptation of symbolic expression into closed-form HSCM formulas, and numerical estimation from fitted local probability models. A key innovation is our adapted Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which decomposes pyAgrum's identified formulas into independent density, expectation, and marginalization tasks, enabling parallel and scalable computation. We validate the pipeline on canonical HSCM motifs and benchmark scenarios with known ground truth, then apply it to STAR kindergarten mathematics outcomes. The results show that flat baselines (ignoring hierarchy) recover associations but fail to encode class-level interventions, and that symbolic identification alone is not enough for practical Hierarchical Structural Causal inference; scalable estimation and numerical stability checks are central parts of the scientific object.
