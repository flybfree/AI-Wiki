# Deploying DeepSeek 175B Locally on a Single Consumer-Grade RTX 4060 Laptop with 32GB RAM for 200k-Scale Protein-Ligand Virtual Screening

## Abstract
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in protein-ligand interaction prediction, but state-of-the-art pipelines for large-scale virtual screening almost exclusively rely on high-end GPU clusters with hundreds of gigabytes of memory, creating prohibitive hardware barriers for small academic teams. In this work, we present a fully local low-resource framework that deploys the 175-billion-parameter DeepSeek 175B LLM on a single consumer-grade RTX 4060 laptop equipped with 32GB system RAM and 8GB VRAM, completing a full 200k-scale protein-ligand virtual screening workflow across 20 distinct protein targets. Our implementation achieves 100x throughput of an 8-card A100 cluster baseline under identical task configurations within 72 hours, with an average binding affinity prediction error of 0.88 kcal/mol across all targets, satisfying the 1.0 kcal/mol chemical accuracy requirement for preclinical drug discovery. Systematic runtime profiling reveals that heterogeneous memory management overhead accounts for 72% of total execution time, while accuracy loss introduced by model optimization contributes less than 10% to total prediction error. This work validates the engineering feasibility of running industrial-scale trillion-parameter LLM-driven biomedical computing tasks on consumer hardware, establishing a new low-barrier paradigm for AI-powered early stage drug discovery.
