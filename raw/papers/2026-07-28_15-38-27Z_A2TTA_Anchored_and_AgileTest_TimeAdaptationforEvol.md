# A2TTA: Anchored-and-Agile Test-Time Adaptation for Evolving Traffic Sensor Networks

## Abstract
Traffic forecasting is important for efficient traffic management and route planning in smart cities. Existing traffic forecasting studies typically assume fixed sensor graphs, overlooking the continuous evolution of real-world traffic networks, e.g., ongoing road network construction and evolving human mobility patterns. These dynamic changes can substantially degrade conventional forecasting models, motivating test-time adaptation (TTA) to efficiently adapt pretrained models during deployment. However, applying TTA to evolving traffic sensor networks remains challenging in two aspects. First, topology expansion introduces new sensors and connections, continuously reshaping the sensor graph. Second, tem- poral shifts vary in time scale and stability, requiring differentiated adaptation to long-term and short-term shifts. In this study, we address these challenges by proposing A2TTA, an Anchored-and-Agile Test-Time Adaptation framework for evolving traffic sensor networks, which transforms topology-induced forecasting errors into an expandable output calibration problem and separates tem- poral adaptation into persistent global correction and agile context-specific specialization. By jointly addressing topology evolution and multi-scale temporal shifts, A2TTA enables efficient and robust adaptation to continuously evolving traffic environments. Extensive experiments on ten real-world traffic networks demonstrate that A2TTA consistently improves forecasting performance across different backbones, datasets, and prediction horizons.
