# Amortizing the Calibration Triple: A Projection-Consistent Neural Operator for Local-Stochastic Volatility

## Abstract
Local-stochastic volatility (LSV) combines vanilla marginals with richer smile dynamics, but calibration requires a slow, noisy and sequential McKean--Vlasov fixed point. We learn a projection-consistent operator for the calibration triple. Given finite quotes and a stochastic-volatility (SV) backbone, it jointly returns an implied-volatility surface subject to static-arbitrage constraints, its Dupire local volatility, LSV leverage and the conditional moment required by the projection identity. Starting from option-price marginals, we derive a division-free Dupire residual in log-implied-variance coordinates and a quotient Fokker--Planck equation after Gyöngy projection. Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) implementations enforce quote fit, static-arbitrage, Dupire and projection constraints. For the witness-augmented residual system, we prove conditional identification and empirical consistency under LSV existence and inverse residual stability. In controlled synthetic tests, forward-start and cliquet errors differ from a particle method by 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points, while calibration latency falls from 98.5 to 0.6 ms. Compared with the tested baselines, local-volatility root-mean-square error (RMSE) falls by 36% and leverage RMSE by 7-16%. These results support amortizing the LSV fixed point: the expensive solve moves offline, while online calibration reduces to a single projection-consistent operator evaluation.
