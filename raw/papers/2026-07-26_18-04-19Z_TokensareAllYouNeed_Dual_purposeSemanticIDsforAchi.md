# Tokens are All You Need: Dual-purpose Semantic IDs for Achieving LLM-Level I/O Efficiency in recommendation systems

## Abstract
Large-scale recommendation systems face "Memory Wall" bottlenecks due to massive, dense embedding tables. While generative retrieval uses discrete tokens for IDs, high-dimensional context still relies on inefficient dense formats. Inspired by computer vision data compression, we propose Dual-purpose Semantic IDs to achieve LLM-level I/O efficiency. Our methodology uses hierarchical quantization to condense continuous embeddings into discrete Semantic IDs performing two concurrent roles: (1) Collaborative Identity: modeling user-item interactions via learnable embedding table; and (2) Content Reconstruction: using a lightweight Semantic Decoder for on-the-fly embedding approximation. This approach replaces massive vector storage with on-demand reconstruction, reducing system overhead and data footprints. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through offline evaluations and successful online deployment in production-scale ranking and retrieval systems at a major video sharing platform, showing that discrete tokens are indeed all you need for highly efficient, content-rich recommendation.
