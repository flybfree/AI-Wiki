# GALA: Graph-Augmented LLM Agents for Root Cause Analysis and Incident Response in Microservices

## Abstract
Microservice root cause analysis (RCA) requires correlating failures across heterogeneous telemetry within complex service dependency graphs. Existing methods often rely on a single telemetry modality; recent LLM-based approaches can suffer from unconstrained exploration and hallucination; and most systems stop at fault ranking without producing actionable incident response. We present GALA+, a graph-augmented LLM agentic framework centered on graph-guided investigation, which uses service dependencies to bound exploration and refine diagnosis through localized multi-modal evidence. For initial hypothesis generation, GALA+ combines complementary telemetry signals with STRIX, a novel trace- and graph-structure-aware scoring module. GALA+ then produces ranked diagnoses, incident summaries, and stratified action recommendations. We further introduce SURE-Score, a human-guided evaluation framework co-developed with industry SRE experts for assessing RCA-specific output quality beyond conventional text similarity metrics. On two microservice benchmarks, GALA+ consistently achieves the strongest overall results, surpassing the best LLM-based baseline by more than 25 percentage points in AC@1, while also receiving the highest ratings from both SURE-Score and independent human SRE evaluation.
