# Can Coding Agents Solve Repository-Level Issues with Rendered Code? An Exploratory Study of Visual Representations

## Abstract
Visual modality has recently been explored as a way to compress textual tokens, including rendering code as images for static code understanding. We study whether this representation can serve as operational context for agentic coding, where an agent must navigate repositories, edit source files, and verify executable patches. Using SWE-bench Verified, we evaluate rendered code in repository-level repair workflows and introduce controlled agent settings to separate unguided repository exploration from more structured repair stages. Our results show a mixed picture. Rendered code consistently reduces prompt-token cost, but the savings do not increase linearly with the nominal visual compression ratio. It largely preserves end-to-end repair accuracy, but does not overcome the performance limits of the underlying model or agent architecture, and can become unstable under aggressive compression. Further analysis suggests that visual code is most useful when raw source reading is a major bottleneck; once repository localization is structured, much of the remaining cost comes from patch--test trial-and-error, where visual compression has limited leverage. Overall, our study positions rendered code as a viable but conditional compression mechanism for realistic coding agents.
