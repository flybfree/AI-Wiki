# Modalities Should Talk to Each Other: Dual-Stream Multimodal Learning for Long-Horizon Influenza Forecasting

## Abstract
Forecasting long-range influenza-like illness (ILI) matters for public health readiness. Publicly available surveillance datasets typically pair numeric epidemiological signals with textual information that is noisy, loosely structured, only indirectly related to near-term trends, and often lagged relative to the numeric signal. Fusing the two therefore requires careful design. We propose Dual-Stream Attention (DSA), a multimodal deep learning framework that forecasts 12-week-ahead ILI activity from a 36-week multimodal history by letting the numerical and textual streams condition each other. Using the Time-MMD health-domain dataset, DSA separately encodes the two modalities with a Transformer-based numerical encoder and a domain-adapted headline encoder, then couples them through a bidirectional Cross-Modal Attention (CMA) mechanism: the text (news headlines) conditions the interpretation of the numeric signal and vice versa. The CMA output then passes to a causal temporal model for forecasting. Evaluated across ten random seeds, DSA achieves a median test MSE of 0.416, versus 0.668, 0.607, and 0.851 for iTransformer, TaTS, and GPT4MTS, corresponding to mean-error reductions of 54.95%, 37.29%, and 67.23%, with paired Cohen's d of 0.555, 0.337, and 0.345, respectively, and ranks first in 100% of bootstrap draws. It also has substantially lower worst-window error than all baselines. On an external-geography dataset, DSA again ranks first among nine evaluated baselines. Ablations show the advantage does not depend on text-encoder choice or language-model fine-tuning, and that bidirectional attention outperforms either direction alone. Finally, perturbation-based faithfulness analysis shows the learned CMA is functionally informative under targeted masking, with a stronger effect in the text-to-numerical direction.
