# LoRA for Gender-Inclusive Rewriting and Activation Steering for Counter-Narrative Generation

## Abstract
Gender-inclusive language generation seeks to transform biased text into inclusive alternatives while preserving semantic meaning and contextual coherence. This paper presents the IHLC system for the LT-EDI 2026 Shared Task, addressing both gender-inclusive rewriting and counter-narrative generation. For gender-inclusive rewriting, we employ parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, achieving an official score of 80.00%. Our primary contribution is a compute-efficient inference-time representation engineering approach for counter-narrative generation. We derive a principal steering direction from contrastive hidden-state activations using principal component analysis (PCA) and inject it into the intermediate representations of Gemma-3-4B-it during inference, enabling behavioral steering toward inclusive responses without modifying model weights. Combined with constrained prompting, this approach produces polite and contextually appropriate counter-narratives, achieving an official score of 78.12%. We further present a manual analysis of steering behavior, identifying key failure modes including semantic drift, residual bias leakage, layer sensitivity, over-steering, and text degeneration. Our findings highlight both the practical potential and current limitations of activation steering as a lightweight alternative to parameter updates for controllable and socially aligned language generation.
