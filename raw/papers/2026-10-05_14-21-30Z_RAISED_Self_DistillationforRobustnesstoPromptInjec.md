# RAISED: Self-Distillation for Robustness to Prompt Injection in LLM Agents

## Abstract
Tool-using language-model agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection because they must act on untrusted external content. Existing training-time defenses can reduce attack success rates, but often at the cost of general capabilities. We show that training-based defenses induce substantial drift in the model's output distribution, altering its behavior even in benign settings and providing a potential mechanism for utility degradation. We further identify a failure mode of these defenses: On benign tool-use tasks, the model refrains from a step needed to finish an authorized task, particularly when that step is indicated by a tool output. To address these limitations, we introduce RAISED (Robust Attack Invariance through Self-Distillation), a training framework that combines self-generation and self-distillation. The model first generates its own tool-use scenarios, with an emphasis on cases where task completion requires acting on legitimate guidance from tool outputs. Then, through self-distillation, the student is trained to match the teacher's clean-context behavior on both clean and injected variants of the same trajectory. RAISED substantially reduces the attack success rate of prompt injections in tool responses while, unlike prior training-based defenses, preserving utility on both agentic and general-purpose benchmarks.
