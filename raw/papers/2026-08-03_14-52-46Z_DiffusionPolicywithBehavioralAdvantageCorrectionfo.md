# Diffusion Policy with Behavioral Advantage Correction for Offline Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract
In offline reinforcement learning (RL), the distribution shift between behavioral data and the learned policy can lead to erroneous \emph{Q}-value estimation, thereby misguiding the direction of policy optimization. To address this issue, we develop a behavioral advantage corrected policy evaluation (BAC-PE) approach, which utilizes the \emph{Q}-function of the behavior policy to correct the learned policy's \emph{Q}-function, thus mitigating pessimistic conservatism and overestimation bias. Furthermore, the convergence of BAC-PE is analyzed theoretically, and an upper bound on the difference between the learned \emph{Q}-function and the true \emph{Q}-function is derived. To alleviate distribution shift, this work employs diffusion models to represent both the behavior policy and the learned policy, performing distribution matching for accurate policy regularization. Additionally, \emph{Q}-value guidance is incorporated into the training process to achieve effective policy improvement. By combining BAC-PE with diffusion policy modeling, we propose the diffusion policy with behavioral advantage correction (DPBAC) algorithm. Compared to existing offline methods, DPBAC demonstrates stronger policy representation capabilities and effectively mitigates the bias in \emph{Q}-value estimation. Experimental results on multiple domains of D4RL tasks show that DPBAC achieves superior performance, with notable advantages over state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms.
