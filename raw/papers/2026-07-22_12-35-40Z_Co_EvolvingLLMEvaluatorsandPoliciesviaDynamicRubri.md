# Co-Evolving LLM Evaluators and Policies via DynamicRubric

## Abstract
Post-training with evaluator feedback on policy-induced samples serves as a major mechanism for improving large language models. As policies improve, these sampled responses become close in quality. These close candidates create a bottleneck for policy optimization: collapsed relative evaluator score gaps yield weak or misleading policy supervision. We theoretically characterize why these gaps matter through a probability allocation view, showing that the directional gain of shifting probability mass from one response to another is exactly the evaluator score gap between them. This identifies relative score gaps as the policy optimization signals that guide updates. Motivated by this view, we propose DynamicRubric, a response-set-conditioned evaluator--policy co-evolution framework that generates weighted binary rubric items for each candidate set and aggregates the resulting judgments into response-level scores. In our experiments with 8B backbones, DynamicRubric improves evaluator performance and provides stronger policy supervision than baselines using a 70B reward model or a 235B static rubric generator. DynamicRubric-optimized policies also show gains on verifiable reasoning and coding tasks. A DynamicRubric-optimized model is fully deployed in WeChat Search's AI answering scenario, where it serves all online traffic across tens of millions of requests per day and improves key online metrics. These results suggest a principle for evaluator-guided post-training: evaluators should evolve with the policies they supervise.
