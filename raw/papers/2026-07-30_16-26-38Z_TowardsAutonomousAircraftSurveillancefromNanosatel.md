# Towards Autonomous Aircraft Surveillance from Nanosatellites through On-Board Inference and Generative Data Augmentation

## Abstract
Airborne surveillance from low Earth orbit is hindered by two interconnected bottlenecks: nanosatellites have a limited downlink budget, yet the conventional approach still transmits terabytes of raw imagery to the ground for processing, and open satellite datasets for aircraft are scarce and severely class-imbalanced. These limitations either delay timely decision-making or prevent standard detectors from learning robust representations of rare aircraft classes. In this paper, a workflow that combines on-board inference with generative data augmentation is proposed to address both limitations jointly. Inference is executed on a 6U CubeSat equipped with a low-power edge tensor accelerator, while a diffusion model fine-tuned through low-rank adaptation generates synthetic minority-class imagery. This synthetic output is automatically annotated, pseudo-labelled, by an intermediate detector and merged with classically augmented samples. The results show that the balanced dataset increases global mean average precision from 77.9% to 82.2%, with the minority class rising from F1=0.683 to F1=0.811, and that the quantised detector fits the on-chip memory and projects 25-30 frames per second on orbit. This approach contrasts with the conventional bent-pipe architecture, in which the satellite acts as a passive data collector. Therefore, the computational tests support the proposed workflow as a decision-support tool for real-time, autonomous airborne surveillance from nanosatellites.
