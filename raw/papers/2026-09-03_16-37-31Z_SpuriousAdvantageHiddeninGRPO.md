# Spurious Advantage Hidden in GRPO

## Abstract
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is widely studied for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, where its advantage estimator assigns each rollout a magnitude from within-group reward statistics. In the common case, this magnitude rewards rollouts that reach the correct answer through reasoning. Yet, an overlooked case shares the same surface: a rollout may land on it by guessing, and the formula still assigns a high magnitude, which we identify as the spurious advantage. This arises in three cases: bounded-answer tasks with a small candidate set; open-answer sets hosting bounded sub-cases; and search agents whose budget opens many paths to the same answer. In all three, this misleads the policy toward guess-like behaviors. We propose SIGNBALANCE, whose magnitude is composition-free: it keeps the verifier sign, uses a global scale, and restores zero-mean balance via a stop-gradient per-class rescaling. Across math and search agent benchmarks at different scales, SIGNBALANCE matches GRPO on open-answer math and improves on bounded-answer math and search agents. Code will be released.
