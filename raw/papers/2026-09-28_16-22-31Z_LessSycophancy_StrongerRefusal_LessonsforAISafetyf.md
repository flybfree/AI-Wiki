# Less Sycophancy, Stronger Refusal? Lessons for AI Safety from Mechanistic Interpretability

## Abstract
Reliable refusal of harmful requests is essential to the safe deployment of language models. Because excessive eagerness to please users may undermine existing refusal capabilities, reducing sycophancy offers a potential route to stronger refusal beyond the harmful scenarios covered by safety training. We investigate this possibility using compensatory feature injection (CFI), a training technique designed to limit the acquisition of a target concept by supplying its associated activation during learning. Across three Qwen3.5 base models, we use sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify the top-ranked sycophancy feature from paired sycophantic and independent responses, then validate its behavioral influence through inference steering. We subsequently inject the selected feature during supervised fine-tuning on sycophantic targets. Positive injection reduces learned sycophancy after removal (by 62.0% relative to ordinary fine-tuning in 35B-A3B), whereas modest negative injection increases it. Unexpectedly, these reductions in sycophancy do not consistently improve direct refusal of harmful requests, motivating a narrower evaluation of the same harmful intents under user pressure. In this setting, ordinary fine-tuning on sycophantic responses substantially weakens refusal, while selected checkpoints trained with positive injection recover part of the loss, including approximately 95% in 35B-A3B. These findings show that persistent sycophancy reduction does not guarantee stronger direct refusal, while identifying recovery under user pressure as a distinct, conditional benefit of training intervention.
