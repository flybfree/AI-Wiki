# Faster-WAM: Do World Action Models Need Deep Action Modules?

## Abstract
World Action Models (WAMs) couple robot action prediction with video world models. Existing WAMs with shared-backbone and Mixture-of-Transformers designs generally tie the depth of the action module to that of the video backbone, resulting in substantial computational overhead and high inference latency. To address this limitation, we introduce Dock of Transformer (DoT), a video-centric design principle that treats a pretrained video Transformer as a representation hub and connects lightweight output-heads through docking interfaces. This enables flexible output-head design while providing direct access to representations from all layers of the backbone. We then introduce \textbf{Faster-WAM}, an instantiation of DoT for WAMs, which docks a single-layer action head onto a 30-layer video backbone. The docking interface fuses keys and values from all video layers and applies RoPE realignment. Without additional embodied pretraining, Faster-WAM achieves competitive performance on LIBERO and RoboTwin 2.0 while demonstrating strong out-of-distribution generalization on LIBERO-Plus. Faster-WAM also achieves the lowest end-to-end latency in our controlled comparison, requiring only 66.5 ms per inference --- a \(3.2\times\) speedup over Fast-WAM. Overall, these results demonstrate that the video-centric DoT architecture supports flexible task-specific head design while delivering low inference latency, strong action-prediction performance, and robust generalization.
