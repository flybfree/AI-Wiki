# Moral Safety in LLMs: Exposing Performative Compliance with Puzzled Cues

## Abstract
As large language models take on morally consequential roles in healthcare, legal, and hiring contexts, we need to examine whether their ethical behaviors are genuine or superficial. We show that current fairness evaluations substantially overestimate moral safety. Models appear fair when demographic identity is stated as an explicit label, yet become measurably less fair when the same identity must be inferred. We term this failure \emph{performative compliance}, where a model is fair when the presentation resembles a fairness evaluation and less fair as that cue weakens. We introduce a cue-variation methodology that holds the moral dilemma and the demographic identity fixed and varies only how that identity is conveyed. Hiding the explicit label raises harmful decisions by $+4.4$~pp and changes model safety rankings, and the shift persists when models correctly infer the demographic, ruling out attribution error. We propose the \textbf{Cue Visibility Gap}, a model-agnostic robustness metric that can be added to any existing fairness benchmark to separate genuine from performative moral safety. Fairness evaluations that omit cue variation measure surface compliance, not moral robustness, and should not ground deployment decisions in high-stakes settings.
