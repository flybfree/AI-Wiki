# Ask, Condition or Abstain: Reinforcement Learning for Missing-Premise Reasoning

## Abstract
Answer-only reinforcement learning (RL) trains reasoning models to solve fully specified problems, but many realistic queries omit a premise needed for a unique answer. In this setting, the useful response is not always refusal: the model should ask for the missing premise, condition its answer on the unknown quantity, or abstain when no informative conditional response is available. We present \emph{Ask-Condition-Abstain Reinforcement Learning} (ACA-RL), a data-augmented RL framework for this setting. Its reasoning-graph-guided pipeline converts well-posed problems into missing-premise training instances with localized gap annotations; ACA-RL then trains on these instances with a structured reward over five observable response behaviors. We also introduce the \emph{Missing-Premise Benchmark} (MPB), a 274-instance human-verified benchmark spanning mathematical, logical, and real-world word problems. Across Qwen3 and Llama models, ACA-RL consistently improves on MPB while preserving competitive performance on well-posed reasoning tasks. Together with the released code, MPB, and training data, this work supports a new mission for NLP evaluation: measuring whether models can recognize when a task is underdetermined and handle uncertainty, not only whether they can answer fully specified questions.
