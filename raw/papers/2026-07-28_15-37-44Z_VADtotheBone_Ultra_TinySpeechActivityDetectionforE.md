# VAD to the Bone: Ultra-Tiny Speech Activity Detection for Edge Deployment

## Abstract
Voice activity detection (VAD) triggers downstream speech processing in always-on systems under strict memory, latency, and compute constraints. Recent compact models report strong accuracy but rely on components that are not widely supported: learnable filterbanks, recurrent layers, or non-causal post-processing. We propose kiloVAD, designed for embedded inference using standard Mel features, CNN-only layers, and tunable context/spectral parameters. We introduce per-layer structured pruning with self-distillation and angle-based quantization-aware training (QAT) that outperforms standard QAT by 1-4%. Evaluated per-frame under causal conditions, kiloVAD achieves 0.850 AUC on AVA-Speech with 2.1 k parameters and 200 ms context, establishing a new state of the art for causal, deployment-ready VAD.
