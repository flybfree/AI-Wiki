# Architecture-Dependent Causal Transfer of Activation States Across Large Language Models

## Abstract
Direct communication between AI systems relies on natural language as an intermediate layer, incurring encoding/decoding overhead, token cost, and latency. We ask whether internal activation states can instead be transferred causally between different large language model (LLM) architectures via a learned projection, evaluated at three levels: representational similarity, cross-model retrieval from projected states, and end-to-end causal transfer via activation injection during generation. Using four architecturally diverse open-weight models (Qwen2-0.5B, Phi-3-mini, Mistral-7B, FLAN-T5-base), we find that representational alignment in trained models exceeds a random-initialization null baseline and is best captured by a rank-based metric (mutual k-nearest-neighbour alignment), more robust to activation-magnitude outliers than centered kernel alignment (CKA) or Procrustes analysis. A learned projection network retrieves the correct target-model representation from a held-out set well above chance for the three causal decoder-only model pairs (45-50% top-1 accuracy vs. 5% chance) but at chance level for the encoder-based FLAN-T5. Injecting projected activations into a target model during generation produces a statistically significant, pre-registered causal effect on retrieval-based output similarity for only one of the three decoder-only pairs (Qwen2-0.5B to Phi-3-mini: 23.3% vs. 0.0% under negative control, p=0.047, FDR-corrected); the two pairs targeting Mistral-7B show no such effect despite comparable representational alignment at the hidden-state level. We interpret these results as evidence for causal transfer of the representational vehicle, not of meaning, and conclude that end-to-end activation-state transfer between LLMs, as currently implemented, is architecture-dependent rather than universal.
