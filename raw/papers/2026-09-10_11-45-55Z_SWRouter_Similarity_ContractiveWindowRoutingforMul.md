# SWRouter: Similarity-Contractive Window Routing for Multi-Turn Large Language Model Conversations

## Abstract
Large language models exhibit complementary strengths, motivating routing methods that dispatch each query to the most suitable model. Although existing routers are effective in single-turn settings, they do not directly transfer to multi-turn dialogue, where routing performance critically depends on how historical context is segmented, retained, and incorporated into the current prompt. This introduces two fundamental challenges: preventing information loss and information confusion during context construction, and evaluating routing quality without conflating model selection with prompt construction quality. In this paper, we propose SWRouter, a Similarity-Contractive Window Router for multi-turn large language model routing. SWRouter combines a similarity-based context segmentation mechanism for prompt construction with a dual-metric evaluation framework that decouples construction accuracy from router performance. Experiments on multi-turn dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that SWRouter consistently surpasses strong baselines, achieving a 16.26% improvement in evaluation accuracy over the best individual large language model and an additional 8.22% gain over the Conv-ID Context baseline. Our results highlight that multi-turn large language model routing requires a joint design of context construction and evaluation, rather than a direct extension of single-turn routing methods.
