# From Machine Learning to Large-Scale EO Products: Best Practices for Making Maps

## Abstract
Recent years have seen a rapid expansion in the production of large-scale geospatial maps derived from Earth observation (EO) data, driven largely by advances in machine learning (ML) and large computing infrastructure. Although the barrier to generating such maps has dropped substantially, established best practices have yet to emerge, and design decisions made early in the pipeline can quietly propagate errors into the final product. Producing a technically sound and scientifically credible product remains challenging. Choices made at every stage are tightly coupled: preprocessing decisions shape the training signal, dataset design governs what the model can learn and how reliably its performance can be assessed, and global-scale inference introduces engineering challenges in compute and data access at scale, as well as artifact mitigation. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification and independent map validation each require dedicated methodological attention that is often underestimated. This paper presents a concise, end-to-end account of the recommended practices spanning the pipeline from satellite data to an operational map product. We organize the discussion around six interconnected themes: the EO data infrastructure landscape, data selection and preprocessing, ML dataset construction and model training, uncertainty quantification, map production and distribution, and validation. This paper is a condensed version of a longer guide that provides greater depth across all stages, accessible online at ghjuliasialelli.github.io/MLEO-Maps/.
