# Evaluating Sycophancy in Chinese Large Language Models on Factual Questions Derived from Online Search Queries

## Abstract
As large language models increasingly mediate information access, factually accurate and independent answers are critical. However, these models can exhibit sycophancy by aligning their responses with users' stated beliefs even when those beliefs are incorrect, potentially presenting misinformation as independently verified and reinforcing users' confidence in false claims. Prior work leaves unresolved whether introducing user beliefs causes correct responses to become incorrect or uncertain, or causes uncertain responses to become belief-aligned incorrect answers. It also remains unclear whether anti-sycophancy interventions preserve or restore factual accuracy or merely shift responses toward uncertainty. We analyze factual sycophancy in Chinese-language information seeking using yes/no fact-checking questions. Our analysis covers 364,941 responses from three frontier Chinese-based LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen, and Doubao) to 12,165 factual questions derived from real-world Chinese search queries. We evaluate the models with and without reasoning across baseline, belief-conditioned, and anti-sycophancy prompting, tracing matched shifts among correct, incorrect, and uncertain responses. Under incorrect user beliefs, we distinguish belief-aligned errors from losses of factual confidence, in which initially correct answers become uncertain. Patterns vary across models and reasoning settings: reasoning is not a consistent safeguard, and anti-sycophancy instructions can reduce incorrect agreement while increasing uncertainty. In Chinese-language factual question answering, avoiding agreement with false beliefs is therefore not equivalent to preserving factual accuracy, highlighting the value of transition-level evaluation. Such behavior may undermine the reliability of LLM-mediated information access by reinforcing misinformation or weakening users' confidence in factually correct answers.
