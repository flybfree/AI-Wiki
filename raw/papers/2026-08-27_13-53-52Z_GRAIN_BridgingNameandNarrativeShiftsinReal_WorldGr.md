# GRAIN: Bridging Name and Narrative Shifts in Real-World Graph Reasoning through Invariance-Rewarded Agentic RL

## Abstract
Despite their potential in standardized graph tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain brittle to real-world shifts in node identifiers and task formulation. While deterministic graph tools are invariant to such shifts, extracting topological structures from noisy text is highly fragile for LLMs, which often overfit to surface patterns. Moreover, mitigating these parsing failures via multi-agent systems incurs prohibitive latency. To address this, we propose GRAIN, a single-agent framework optimized via reinforcement learning. GRAIN models reasoning as a semantic parsing and tool-execution pipeline, guided by a Structure Invariance Reward. By validating extracted intermediate graphs against ground-truth topologies, this reward forces the LLM to learn robust text-to-structure mappings rather than memorizing linguistic artifacts. We also introduce GRIT, a benchmark evaluating sensitivity to such linguistic shifts. GRAIN outperforms multi-agent baselines by 16.45\% in accuracy with approximately 24\% lower latency. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior structural generalization, halving the out-of-distribution (OOD) gap of SFT models (from 15.77\% to 7.80\%) and maintaining robustness on large-scale graphs beyond the training distribution.
