# JIT-Agent: Scaling Harness Intelligence via Just-in-Time Harness Evolution

## Abstract
Agent capability is not determined by the model alone. The agent harness, encompassing memory management, planning strategy, action protocol, and tool/skill orchestration, can dominate the contribution of the underlying foundation model. Yet harness design remains manual, task-specific, and fundamentally unscalable. We present JIT-Agent, a harness intelligence model trained to synthesize task-adaptive agent harnesses on the fly for arbitrary off-the-shelf agentic LLMs. We formalize the agent harness as a composable, machine-generatable artifact governed by a fixed four-module protocol, and train JIT-Agent to customize harnesses for a given task at hand, repair harnesses for stable and reliable execution, and self-evolve by distilling performance signals from an expanding archive of prior harness configurations. Equipped with JIT-Agent as a harness helper, DeepSeek-V4-Flash surpasses GPT-5.6 on DeepSearchQA (+9.1) and OdysseyBench (+4.3), while the already strong GLM-5.2 gains up to +20.2 points. Across controlled evaluations, JIT-Agent-generated harnesses are performance-competitive with mature agent runtimes such as OpenCode and Claude Code and consistently improve multi-scale model families of DeepSeek V4, Mimo-V2.5, and Qwen3.6. To our knowledge, JIT-Agent is the first model purpose-built for just-in-time harness generation, establishing harness intelligence as a trainable, transferable, and compounding dimension of agent capability orthogonal to model scaling.
