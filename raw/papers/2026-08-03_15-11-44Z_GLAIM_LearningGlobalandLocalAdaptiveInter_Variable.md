# GLAIM: Learning Global and Local Adaptive Inter-Variable Dependency for Multivariate Time Series Imputation

## Abstract
Multivariate time series imputation is fundamental to downstream analysis, yet modeling inter-variable dependencies with incomplete observations remains challenging. Existing methods learn global dependencies across samples or dynamic local dependencies per sample. Global dependencies are stable but adapt poorly to sample variations and temporal non-stationarity, whereas local dependencies are adaptive yet unreliable when observations are insufficient, causing erroneous information propagation. To address these limitations, we propose GLAIM, a Global-Local Adaptive Inter-variable Dependency Modeling framework for multivariate time series imputation. GLAIM comprises two complementary components. The Stable Global Dependency Constructor derives robust global inter-variable dependencies from complementary temporal representations, providing a stable backbone less affected by sample-specific missingness and noise. The Sample-Conditioned Dependency Refiner adapts this backbone to each sample and time step using its temporal state and available observations, enabling reliable local refinement under incomplete observations. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that GLAIM achieves state-of-the-art performance under random and block missingness, remains robust to missing-rate shifts, and benefits from its complementary global and local components. Code is available at https://github.com/LuRenjias/GLAIM.
