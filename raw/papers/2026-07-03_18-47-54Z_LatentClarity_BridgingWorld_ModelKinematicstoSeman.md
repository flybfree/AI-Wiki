# Latent Clarity: Bridging World-Model Kinematics to Semantic Manifolds for Video Anomaly Anticipation

## Abstract
Continuous video anomaly detection is dominated by reactive Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) that collapses spatiotemporal features into scalar scores. We introduce PULS (Predictive Unified Latent Space), a continuous semantic world-model pipeline comprising two modules: a 490M-parameter KSD Bridge (Kinematic-to-Semantic Distillation) and a 16.8M-parameter Anticipatory State Predictor (ASP). The KSD Bridge maps V-JEPA 2 physical tensors into the 2048-d Qwen3-VL-Embedding-2B text-aligned hypersphere, trained on a subset of UCF-Crime. This translation alone yields a chunk-level AUROC of 0.8994 for UCF-Crime and 0.8162 for out-of-distribution XD-Violence without MIL or hierarchical fusion.   We introduce and validate the Latent Clarity Hypothesis: because JEPA's temporal predictor discards aleatoric pixel noise while preserving kinematics, anticipated future representations are more semantically separable than observed presents. The ASP sharpens these anticipated future latents, achieving 44.5% mean 14-way zero-shot VQA accuracy (exceeding observation baseline by +9.6 pp). Applying the ASP to Observation Tensors collapses accuracy to 7.3% (random chance), proving Anticipation and Observation occupy distinct sub-manifolds. A Triple-Track Lead-Time protocol with an L1-surprise gate yields a peak +8.9 pp anticipatory advantage at T-0.5s (p < 0.001, N = 1,000 permutation), separating physical anticipation from static scene priors. Zero-shot transfer to XD-Violence confirms that Newtonian-invariant kinematic representations generalize out-of-distribution.
