# Beyond Rephrasing: Book-Level Organization Improves Synthetic Textbook Data for Mid-Training

## Abstract
Synthetic textbook data has improved language model pre-training, but prior work largely treats the benefit as a property of generated content or local rewriting style. We study a different factor: whether related content is organized into coherent book-level documents. We contribute both a scalable synthesis pipeline and controlled evidence that this organization matters. The pipeline retrieves source material from a pre-training corpus, clusters it into topical units, plans hierarchical tables of contents, and assembles source-grounded sections into complete books (our Full setting), yielding 686K textbooks (32B tokens) across 15,000+ disciplines. Replacing natural books in a mid-training mix with this corpus improves downstream performance by +1.09 on average. Controlled comparisons then disentangle the relevant design factors. A content-matched Split condition holds generated text and tokens fixed but treats each section as an independent document; Full's +1.02 mean gain isolates document packaging. A length-matched RandomConcat control that joins sections from different books remains below Full, ruling out document length alone. A retrieval-pool-matched Rephrase condition independently rewrites individual retrieved documents under the same audience-by-style scheme, without clustering, TOC planning, or book assembly; Full's +1.17 gain demonstrates the value of structured synthesis. On Llama3-8B, Full likewise outperforms both RandomConcat and Natural Books, supporting book-level organization as a useful axis for synthetic pre-training data design.
