# Dual-Path LLM Reasoning for Multimodal Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion

## Abstract
Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing facts in knowledge graphs (KGs), thereby improving their completeness and supporting downstream intelligent applications. However, emerging entities and relations in real-world deployments make inductive KGC difficult, especially under few-shot and zero-shot settings. Multimodal information and Large Language Model (LLM)-derived priors can enrich sparse relational contexts, but they may also introduce noisy or hallucinated evidence. To address these issues, we propose DuPLeR, a \textbf{Du}al-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning framework for multimodal few-shot KGC. DuPLeR builds a calibrated relation graph by combining multimodal LLM-derived type priors with factual support structures, and performs dual-level structural reasoning over the refined relation topology. Moreover, a dual-pathway multimodal enhancement module regulates message passing with query-relevant multimodal signals and supplements entity representations after graph propagation. Experiments on eight inductive variants of two multimodal KG (MMKG) benchmarks show that DuPLeR achieves robust performance in data-scarce KGC scenarios.
