# ScreenShot: A Foundation Model for Few-Shot Combination Drug Screening

## Abstract
Treating patients with combinations of drugs reduces the risk of resistance to any individual drug. Finding effective combinations is difficult because the large search space makes combinatorial screens prohibitively expensive, time consuming, and often technically infeasible. Predictive models can fill this gap, yet existing methods typically require molecular profiling of each sample and per-cohort training, limiting their applicability when time and tissue are scarce. To address this challenge, we introduce ScreenShot, a hierarchical transformer pretrained on 40 drug screening datasets covering 3,700 drugs and 6,000 biological samples, whose architecture mirrors the nested structure of screening data. Given a few-shot context of observations from a new patient, ScreenShot predicts the response of the sample to combination therapies through in-context learning, operating directly on functional measurements with no fine-tuning and no molecular profiling. On four held-out datasets, ScreenShot outperforms all baselines in both prediction accuracy and identification of selectively effective treatments. ScreenShot's internal representations are directly useful for experimental design: we use them to drive a weighted k-means++ active learning strategy that selects which experiments to run, achieving the same hit detection as uniform screening with a third of the budget.
