# LongPuzzleBench: Evaluating GUI Agents on Long-Horizon Visual Puzzles

## Abstract
GUI agents need long-horizon visual reasoning: they must interpret a changing interface while keeping a multi-step plan viable as earlier actions constrain later ones. Existing benchmarks evaluate grounding, computer use, and game play, but rarely test whether agents stay coherent across long chains of coupled decisions. Long-horizon visual puzzles expose this capability directly: a legal move that looks like progress can make the puzzle unsolvable, and the loss shows only several moves later. We introduce LongPuzzleBench, 114 levels in six puzzle games played through native GUI actions, where one objective can take a human over a thousand actions on persistent boards and dead ends go unannounced. With Native GUI Actions alone, the strongest agents solve most objectives, but success falls sharply on harder, longer boards: seven of ten general-purpose agents solve nothing harder than Medium, and none completes Bolt Unscrew Hard, which a human solves along with every other objective. Code Execution CUA does not close this gap, and its scores mix visual solving with algorithmic search. Controlled diagnostics trace these failures to one limitation that neither rules, state hints, nor failure memory removes: agents judge each move by the visible progress it makes, not by the future options it leaves.
