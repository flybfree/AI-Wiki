# A Combined Feature-Based Framework for Disguise and Spoofing Detection in Face Recognition Systems

## Abstract
Face recognition systems face two distinct, commonly-separated failure modes: spoofing, where an impostor presents a photograph or video of an authorized user, and disguise, where a legitimate user is rejected because their appearance differs from their enrolled template due to accessories, facial hair, illumination, or pose. This paper proposes and compares five combined feature-extraction and classification pipelines that address both problems within a single framework: PM (PCA and Minimum Euclidean Distance, MED), LPM (Local Binary Patterns with PCA and MED), HPM (Histogram of Oriented Gradients with PCA and MED), SM (Speeded-Up Robust Features with MED), and HM (Harris corner features with MED). Each pipeline follows a common two-phase process comprising pre-processing, feature extraction, feature filtering, and classification. The methods were trained on 115 subjects drawn from the FEI, Disguised Faces Database, and NUAA databases and evaluated on six test conditions covering mixed appearances, frontal faces, dark illumination, left- and right-turned poses, and photo-spoofing attempts. The HOG-based pipeline (HPM) achieved the most consistent performance across conditions, with 94.59% accuracy on mixed-appearance disguise, 81.5-93.2% across pose and illumination variants, and 91.67% on spoofing, while the LBP-based pipeline (LPM) achieved the highest spoofing-detection accuracy (93.2%) but weaker robustness to pose change. These results reveal a measurable trade-off between spoof sensitivity and disguise robustness among classical feature representations, motivating the deep-learning and cross-database extensions discussed in the concluding sections.
