# Zero-Shot Heart Rate Variability Forecasting from Consumer Wearables Using Time Series Foundation Models

## Abstract
Short-term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) forecasting could provide clinicians with actionable lead time for detecting autonomic dysfunction and adverse cardiac events. Consumer wearable devices generate fragmented, artifact-rich HRV signals that challenge conventional forecasting approaches. In this study, we evaluated the forecasting ability of three Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), TimesFM, Chronos, and MOIRAI, against traditional baselines (Mean, Exponential Smoothing, and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) on real-world wearable data collected from 49 healthy individuals. To address data fragmentation, we introduce a variability-preserving imputation method that augments linear interpolation with locally adaptive stochastic noise, retaining physiological dynamics essential for accurate forecasting. The results show that TSFMs outperformed all baselines without fine-tuning, achieving average Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) between 0.81 and 0.87 across TSFMs and both context lengths (32 and 64 time steps), with Chronos and TimesFM as the top models, though MOIRAI showed limited gains over baselines. With up to a 2-hour forecast horizon, the results establish a baseline for TSFMs' performance on a real-world dataset, highlighting domain-specific fine-tuning as a promising direction for clinical deployment.
