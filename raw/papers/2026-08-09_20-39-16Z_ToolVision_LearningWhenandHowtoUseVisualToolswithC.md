# ToolVision: Learning When and How to Use Visual Tools with Capability-Aligned Supervision

## Abstract
Thinking with images allows a multimodal model to compensate for limited perception by invoking visual tools through code. Yet the prevailing SFT-then-RL recipe creates a different supervision misalignment at each stage. SFT is expected to teach how to use tools, but trajectories from stronger teachers may succeed through perceptual capabilities that a smaller student cannot reliably reproduce or exploit, causing the student to imitate tool-call patterns without learning how to make them useful. RL is expected to teach when to use tools, but outcome-only rewards make fallible tool execution a liability and suppress tool use, whereas a blanket bonus for every correct tool-using trajectory encourages valid but ineffective operations. To address these two misalignments, we introduce ToolVision. During SFT, a multi-agent pipeline explores candidate trajectories, and a committee including student-scale models scores stepwise evidence gain to rank and prune the search branches. Only successfully executed trajectories with correct final answers are retained for SFT. Before RL, ToolVision compares the learner's performance with and without tools, then rewards successful tool use only on questions where tools provide a clear benefit. Both signals are constructed automatically from public task data without additional human annotations of tool use or necessity. ToolVision-8B improves over its base on all seven main benchmarks, surpasses Thyme-7B, CodeVision-8B, and CodeDance-7B on all three high-resolution benchmarks, and outperforms Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking on V* and HRBench 8K. We will publicly release the datasets and source code.
