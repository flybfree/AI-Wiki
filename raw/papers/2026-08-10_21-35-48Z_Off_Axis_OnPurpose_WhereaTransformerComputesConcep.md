# Off-Axis, On Purpose: Where a Transformer Computes Concepts and Why it Does So

## Abstract
A transformer's answer lives on one axis: the direction its unembedding reads. Its intermediate states largely do not, and that off-axis position is usually treated as an obstacle to interpretation. We show it is functional. A 12-layer model computes in two phases. Through the first, every sublayer writes into a subspace held near-orthogonal to the read-out, attention 75 to 96 degrees off it at every depth. Moving attention's values onto the read-out is 64 to 84 times more damaging than a matched random rotation, and the damage is entirely in cross-token mixing: the subspace insulates composition from the vocabulary. Beneath it the frame itself turns rigidly with depth. In the second phase the answer arrives on-axis, late, and by addition rather than by turning accumulated content onto the read-out.   Pressing every layer onto the read-out instead, as training for early exit does, matches the baseline on perplexity, LAMBADA and BLiMP while cutting the concept-phase workspace from about twenty-five effective dimensions to fourteen, a change none of those benchmarks register. The geometry can also be imposed, though not by asking for it. Prescribing it through the loss is a lottery: six of eight seeds collapse, because a model told to null its read-out projection obeys most cheaply by discarding dimensions. Inserting one fixed rotation at the phase boundary lands it instead, at baseline quality. A sparse rotation the surrounding weights can absorb converges on all nine seeds, against five of nine for ordinary training. Which rotation is immaterial: twenty-five runs across thirteen distinct ones reach the same quality, and two baselines from different seeds hold their concepts in near-orthogonal frames while agreeing on their read-outs. That freedom is usable: a basis drawn at random and prescribed before training is adopted across the concept phase, with quality unchanged.
