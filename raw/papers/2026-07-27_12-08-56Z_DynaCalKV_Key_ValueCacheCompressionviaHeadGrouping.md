# DynaCalKV: Key-Value Cache Compression via Head Grouping and Adaptive Rank Allocation

## Abstract
As the inference phase of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires handling long context windows, the Key-Value (KV) cache initially appears to address this challenge but eventually becomes a significant bottleneck as the context window continues to grow. Low-rank compression has recently been studied as an effective approach to reduce KV cache memory while maintaining model performance. However, only a few existing methods treat the Key and Value caches differently, despite their distinct roles. Moreover, these methods typically employ fixed attention-head grouping, which may not fully exploit the structural similarity among attention heads. In this paper, we propose an improved low-rank KV cache compression framework. For the Key cache, we dynamically group attention heads based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity and allocate the rank budget adaptively under a parameter budget. For the Value cache, we adopt the same approach as ReCalKV, refining the low-rank decomposition through offline calibration to improve reconstruction quality. Experimental results on three instruction-tuned LLMs show that our method reduces the number of Key cache parameters while maintaining competitive accuracy. We further observe that the proposed strategy is particularly effective for Multi-Head Attention (MHA) models, whereas it should be applied more conservatively to Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) models, especially in long-context settings.
