# The Missing Minimal Pair: Stereotype Evaluation in LLMs

## Abstract
A common approach to measuring bias in Large Language Models is to compare the log-likelihoods of two contrastive stereotype sentences. We argue that such single-pair comparisons are often unreliable: simply rewriting the same stereotype with an alternative attribute can yield logically inconsistent preferences. To address this, we propose a dual minimal pair setup that introduces two axes of comparison for robust stereotype evaluation. First, we present a data-augmentation framework that fills critical gaps in existing stereotype datasets by generating paraphrases and alternate attributes. We apply our framework on a set of English, Russian, Spanish and Chinese stereotypes. Second, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored to the dual minimal pair setup. One of these metrics provides a new perspective on bias by modeling the mutual information (MI) between social groups and stereotyped attributes. This MI-based metric is better suited for aggregation and enables more robust comparisons of stereotype strength across different languages and models.   Our code is available at https://github.com/stepanat/missing-minimal-pair/.
