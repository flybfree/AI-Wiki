# Operating Multi-Node Full Fine-Tuning on NVIDIA B300: A Field Report on Telemetry-Based Triage, Negative Results, and Operational Hardening

## Abstract
We report operational experience full-fine-tuning a 32.76B-parameter dense model (Qwen3-32B) on 16 x NVIDIA B300 (two nodes, FSDP / ZeRO-3) -- among the first published field accounts on this accelerator. We claim no new algorithm. The individual mechanisms we use are established practice; our contribution is the integrated field experience and a set of calibrated measurements on new hardware. Concretely we offer four practitioner artifacts. (1) A B300-calibrated power-draw triage table that distinguishes compute / communication / data-starvation / checkpoint-or-deadlock / idle by board wattage (utilization% reads 100% during an NCCL hang). (2) A set of honest negative results that dispel common optimization folklore at this scale: a controlled A/B in which per-step NFS reading matches a pretokenized local cache (~53k tok/s) because the corpus fits in page cache and the job is compute-bound; and a reconstruction of an earlier "throughput collapse" as NFS/CPU contention rather than a storage-medium limit. (3) Calibrated 4/8/16-GPU strong-scaling and GPU-hour numbers on B300 (near-linear, as expected in this regime; we report absolute values as reference data). (4) A worked failure case -- an epoch-end NCCL deadlock from per-rank token-packing imbalance -- together with a 2.7-second pre-run invariant gate and an external watcher that turn multi-hour silent failures into instant rejections. This deadlock and its remedy correspond to PyTorch's documented Join / equalize-to-minimum practice; we position our instantiation against that prior art and report the GPU-hours the failure cost and the gate saves. The transferable takeaway is operational, not algorithmic: for data-dependent data-parallel jobs, watch power rather than utilization, and verify invariants before launch -- a passing smoke test is not evidence of a safe full run.
