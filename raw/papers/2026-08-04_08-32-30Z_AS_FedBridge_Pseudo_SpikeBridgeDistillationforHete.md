# AS-FedBridge: Pseudo-Spike Bridge Distillation for Heterogeneous ANN-SNN Federated Learning

## Abstract
Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed edge devices while strictly preserving data privacy. To facilitate practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their sparse computing mechanisms and high energy efficiency. However, jointly training ANNs and SNNs exposes a challenge of representational misalignment, which is intrinsically caused by differences in information representation, specifically the semantic gap between continuous real-valued activations in ANNs and discrete spatio-temporal spikes in SNNs. To overcome this barrier, we propose AS-FedBridge, a novel federated learning framework tailored for mixed ANN-SNN clients. AS-FedBridge features a lightweight Bridge equipped with a Pseudo-Spike Interface, which effectively projects continuous signals into a spike-compatible space to facilitate ANN-SNN alignment. Given the absence of existing mixed ANN-SNN federated frameworks, we establish a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate against multiple advanced heterogeneous FL methods. Our empirical analysis demonstrates a positive correlation between the degree of ANN-SNN alignment and the collaborative FL performance. Across four datasets, AS-FedBridge consistently demonstrates advanced accuracy while mitigating extreme scale, architecture, and client heterogeneity challenge. Furthermore, our framework enables a highly controllable trade-off between model performance and resource efficiency. AS-FedBridge accomplishes these robust performance gains while introducing only marginal computational overhead, establishing a robust and practical foundation for mixed ANN-SNN federated learning systems.
