# MUPA$^{2}$E: Multimodal Unified Perception with Asymmetric Attention for Emotion Assessment

## Abstract
Automatic emotion assessment can benefit from combining neural and behavioral signals, but many multimodal approaches rely on separate, modality-specific feature-extraction pipelines before fusion. This paper presents MUPA\textsuperscript{2}E, a unified perception framework that processes facial video and electroencephalography (EEG) through a single shared asymmetric-attention backbone. Facial video is represented through axis-folded frame tokens, while EEG is processed either as a raw multichannel waveform or projected into the spatial domain for multimodal fusion. The framework is evaluated on the DMER dataset under a stratified subject-independent protocol, comparing unimodal video, unimodal EEG, and fused video--EEG configurations with per-channel and merged EEG projections. Using the original recordings, with shorter trials zero-padded to match the longest duration, merged fusion at stride~$30$ achieves the highest validation performance and a test accuracy of $70.07\%$. Further analysis revealed that recording duration is unevenly distributed across the affective classes, making the padding pattern a potential classification cue. Controlling for this factor by cropping all recordings to a common duration of $20$ seconds yielded a test accuracy of $62.71\%$, providing a stricter duration-controlled assessment of the framework in which differences in recording length are removed as a potential classification cue. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of processing structurally different neural and visual signals within a compact unified architecture while highlighting the importance of controlling duration-related cues in affective datasets.
