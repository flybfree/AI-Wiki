# From Student Risk Prediction to SC2R: Semantics-Constrained Counterfactual Recourse for Educational Decision Support

## Abstract
Learning analytics models can identify students at risk of poor performance, but they do not directly indicate which interventions are feasible, actionable, and compatible with educational constraints. This paper introduces SC2R, a semantics-constrained counterfactual recourse framework for educational decision support. SC2R combines a calibrated predictive model, integer-programming-based recourse generation over discrete action variables, a lightweight RDF vocabulary for intervention-plan representation, and SHACL validation for enforcing timing, budget, immutability, and availability constraints. The framework is evaluated offline on the OULAD dataset using snapshots constructed relative to each assessment at two decision horizons. Results show that the predictive component provides strong performance, that compact intervention plans can be generated at scale, and that semantic validation reveals infeasible plans that lighter optimization-only settings would otherwise accept. Rather than claiming causal improvement in student outcomes, this work shows that counterfactual recourse becomes more operationally meaningful in education when recommendations are not only model-valid, but also semantically feasible and machine-checkable.
