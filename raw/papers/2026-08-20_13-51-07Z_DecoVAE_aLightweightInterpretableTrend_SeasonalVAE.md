# DecoVAE: a Lightweight Interpretable Trend-Seasonal VAE Framework for Efficient Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting

## Abstract
Probabilistic time series forecasting remains challenging, largely because modeling distinct trend and seasonal dynamics requires specialized approaches. Existing methods often fail to capture the unique inner properties of these components, lack interpretability, or suffer from heavy memory and runtime overhead. To address these limitations, we propose DecoVAE, a lightweight interpretable trend-seasonal VAE framework that explicitly decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components by applying domain-specific inductive biases. The trend stream enforces structural smoothness using a differential regularizer on the latent trajectory, analogous to the Hodrick-Prescott filter. Concurrently, the seasonal stream operates in the frequency domain via a complex Gaussian VAE, natively capturing the amplitude and phase of periodic patterns. Extensive evaluations across seven real-world benchmarks show that DecoVAE consistently outperforms strong baselines. It achieves reductions of up to 14.96\% in CRPS and 23.30\% in NMAE for short-term forecasting, and up to 52.68\% and 26.51\% for long-term horizons. Crucially, DecoVAE yields these accuracy gains while remaining highly efficient, reducing model weight by up to 93\% and accelerating speed by up to 74\% compared to the second-best method.
