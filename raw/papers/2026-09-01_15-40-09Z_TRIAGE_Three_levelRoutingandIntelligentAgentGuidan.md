# TRIAGE: Three-level Routing and Intelligent Agent Guidance for Efficient Execution

## Abstract
Large Language Model (LLM) agents based on the ReAct paradigm have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tool use and task execution. However, ReAct suffers from a fundamental efficiency problem: every query triggers a complete reasoning loop from scratch, and similar queries repeat identical steps without leveraging historical experience. We propose TRIAGE,a three-level routing framework that reduces token consumption by reusing historical execution trajectories. Its core innovation is TaaS (Trajectory-as-a-Skill), which abstracts historical execution trajectories into reusable skills, realizing 'experience as a service'. TRIAGE classifies queries into three levels: (1) Direct Reuse-identical queries, 0 tokens; (2) Skill Substitution-similar queries, 0 tokens via deterministic parameter substitution; (3) Full ReAct-novel queries, automatically stored for future reuse. In large-scale experiments on 1,007 security monitoring queries, TRIAGE achieves 62.3% token savings, with 56.0% of queries at Level 2 and 5.5% at Level 1, both executing at zero cost. Cross-domain validation on ToolBench (15 domains, 345 queries) achieves 76.3% token reduction, confirming the generalizability of semantic routing. An online learning experiment demonstrates cold-start-to-mature evolution: the L2 hit rate rises from 0% to 57% within the first 100 queries, and the average token cost drops from 198 to 74.7. We also propose an automatic Skill extraction mechanism that distills high-frequency trajectory patterns into deterministic Skills, creating a positive feedback loop of 'the more you use it, the more efficient it becomes'.
