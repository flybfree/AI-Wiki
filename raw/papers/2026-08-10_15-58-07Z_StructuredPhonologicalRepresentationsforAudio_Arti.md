# Structured Phonological Representations for Audio-Articulatory rtMRI Speech Classification

## Abstract
Real-time MRI makes it possible to observe vocal-tract articulation during speech, but mapping these articulatory patterns to phonetic and phonological categories remains challenging. We investigate whether PhonoQ, an audio-based model trained to recognize structured phonological features, provides useful information for audio--articulatory modeling. Specifically, we extract representations from PhonoQ's Conformer module, whose training is shaped by supervision for manner, place, voicing, and vowel features. Using articulatory contours with synchronized audio-derived features, we compare WavLM-large and HuBERT-large baselines with models that incorporate PhonoQ-derived representations. Across unseen-speech and unseen-subject settings, these features improve macro-F1 for phonological targets including manner, place, voicing, vowel height, and vowel backness, and also improve fine-grained 39-phoneme classification. In a contour-only inference setting, audio-derived teacher supervision yields modest but consistent gains over contour-only training, indicating that phonological information from synchronized audio can be partially transferred to articulatory models. Finally, posterior analyses show interpretable surface-sensitive patterns consistent with flapping-like /t/ realizations, /t/-/r/ retraction or affrication, and nasal place assimilation.
