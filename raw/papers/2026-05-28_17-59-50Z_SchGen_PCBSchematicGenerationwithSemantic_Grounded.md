# SchGen: PCB Schematic Generation with Semantic-Grounded Code Representations

## Abstract
Printed circuit board (PCB) schematic design defines nearly all electronic hardware, but it remains manual and expertise-intensive. While generative AI has advanced digital and analog IC design, PCB schematic generation from natural-language intent is largely unexplored. This paper presents SchGen, the first large language model that generates editable PCB schematics from natural-language requests. The key challenge lies in the lack of an LLM-suited representation and a large-scale dataset. Current schematic formats are dominated by verbose, tool-specific syntax and geometry-heavy descriptions, making them difficult to generate reliably. We introduce a semantically grounded code representation that encodes schematic editing primitives with relative placement and pin-name-based wiring, transforming a geometry-driven generation problem into a semantics-driven matching task amenable to LLMs. We further construct a large-scale dataset of PCB schematics paired with user prompts via a human-agent collaborative pipeline that converts open-source hardware designs into our representation. Experiments show that SchGen significantly outperforms alternative representations and even larger general-purpose LLMs on wire connectivity accuracy and functional correctness. Our results highlight the critical role of representation design in enabling generative models for complex hardware design tasks.
