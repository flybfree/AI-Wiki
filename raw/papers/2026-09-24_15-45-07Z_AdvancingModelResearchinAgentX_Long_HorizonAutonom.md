# Advancing Model Research in AgentX: Long-Horizon Autonomy for Industrial Recommender Systems

## Abstract
Sustaining industrial recommendation research requires using the results of one experiment to decide what to investigate next. We present AgentX-Model, the next generation of AgentX's model research framework, which connects proposal development and model experimentation within sandboxes defined by business inputs and prediction tasks. AgentX-Model adopts a dual-agent architecture comprising a Research Agent and a Model Agent. The Research Agent develops independently reviewed proposals from papers and experimental findings, while the Model Agent conducts multi-round investigations and returns code, measurements, and unresolved questions. Using the returned results, the Research Agent selects a starting implementation and formulates the next research question, allowing subsequent experiments to build on earlier findings. We organize this continuing research around four actions: Reproduce, Follow-up, Composition, and Diagnose. The first three actions drive routine research, while Diagnose acquires the evidence needed to choose a repair, including for issues raised by business feedback and online evaluation, such as prediction bias measured by PCOC. Across the production evaluation, 560 of 636 completed model-changing experiments recorded AUC above their business baselines. As research continued, some experiments recorded AUC above every comparable ancestor in their lineages. The five latest online A/B evaluations across different business settings reported gains including 10-15% in acquisition efficiency, 15-20% in target-segment advertising spend, and 0.3-0.8% in watch time; the watch-time model used approximately 10% fewer FLOPs and parameters. A dependency-aware historical-replay benchmark further evaluates research allocation, with initial results showing no consistent efficiency gain from more complex scheduling when agents already analyze and select concrete candidates.
