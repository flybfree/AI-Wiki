# Multi-Objective Ranking for Live-Streaming: Balancing Fresh and Delayed Signals with Segment-Aware Targeting

## Abstract
One of the most challenging problems entertainment live-streaming services face in recommendation systems is that user behaviors are sparse and delayed, and interaction data exhibits bias for different user segments. Unlike e-commerce applications where user actions follow linear sequences, live-streaming viewers engage in multiple concurrent behaviors of watching, chatting, following, and spending, each occurring with varying delays. We address these challenges through three key contributions: 1) a delayed window approach that extends feedback collection beyond immediate responses, 2) a multi-model architecture that combines fresh and delayed signals, and a segment-aware targeting module that optimizes ranking scores differently across user lifecycle stages, and 3) Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) integration that jointly models correlated targets while reducing model parameters by 41.9% compared to independent models. Online A/B testing demonstrates significant improvements, including a +0.09% increase in Daily Active Viewers (DAV), generating millions more annual active viewer days, and +0.56% increase in highly engaged viewers' capped Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). Viewer-segment targeting achieved an additional +0.15% DAV improvement for newer and less engaged viewers, while MMoE enhancement added +0.08% overall DAV and +0.27% new follows. The proposed system processes ranking requests with low latency, providing a scalable approach for balancing multiple business objectives across diverse user populations. In addition, we tested the multi-model architecture on the Twitch mobile live feed and achieved a +1.12% increase in positive user-channel interactions (clicks, follows, and likes), demonstrating applicability beyond the primary use case.
