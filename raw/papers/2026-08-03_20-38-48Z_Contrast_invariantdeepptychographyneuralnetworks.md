# Contrast-invariant deep ptychography neural networks

## Abstract
Ptychography neural networks suffer from scaling inconsistencies when generalizing out of distribution, limiting their real world viability. We address this scaling mismatch using a factorization strategy which decouples the learned object texture from measurement scaling, enabling a single trained network to produce measurement-consistent reconstructions across varying illumination conditions. This requires predicting the learned object in real and imaginary units instead of the canonical amplitude and phase representation. We additionally introduce a synthetic object sampling strategy that minimizes phase distribution mismatch between synthetic training data and experimental targets. These improvements yield up to a 5x reduction in Fourier error over the previous PtychoPINN-torch baseline across 5 experimental datasets spanning multiple beamlines and facilities.
