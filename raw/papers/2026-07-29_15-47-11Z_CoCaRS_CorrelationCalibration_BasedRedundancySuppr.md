# CoCaRS: Correlation Calibration-Based Redundancy Suppression for Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation

## Abstract
Knowledge distillation (KD) enables a compact student model to learn from a powerful teacher and has become an effective paradigm for model compression. The emergence of diverse model architectures has extended KD from homogeneous to heterogeneous settings. However, differences in architectural inductive biases between the teacher and student models often result in substantial representation discrepancies, limiting the effectiveness of direct knowledge transfer. Recently, redundancy suppression has offered a new perspective on heterogeneous KD by preserving cross-architecture invariance and reducing feature redundancy through decorrelation of teacher-student feature correlations. Nevertheless, this formulation may weaken useful structural information through uniform decorrelation, while a fixed coefficient may make the effective contribution of redundancy suppression sensitive to teacher-student pairs and training stages. To address these problems, Correlation Calibration-based Redundancy Suppression (CoCaRS) is proposed to better retain structural information while suppressing redundancy and reduce sensitivity to coefficient settings across teacher-student pairs and training stages. Specifically, CoCaRS calibrates feature decorrelation through Confusion Evidence Estimation (CEE) and Strength Allocation Control (SAC), which respectively capture reliable semantic relations for correlation estimation and preserve discriminative structure during decorrelation. Adaptive Coefficient Regulation (ACR) further regulates the contribution of the calibrated redundancy suppression objective according to its relative loss scale, reducing sensitivity to coefficient settings. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of CoCaRS in improving distillation performance and reducing sensitivity to coefficient settings. Code will be released soon.
