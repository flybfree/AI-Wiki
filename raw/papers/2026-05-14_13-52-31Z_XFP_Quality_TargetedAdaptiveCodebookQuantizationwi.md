# XFP: Quality-Targeted Adaptive Codebook Quantization with Sparse Outlier Separation for LLM Inference

## Abstract
We introduce XFP, a dynamic weight quantizer for LLM inference that inverts the conventional workflow: the operator specifies reconstruction quality floors on per-channel cosine similarity (one strict floor for attention and shared experts, one lazy floor for routed-expert MoE); XFP determines codebook size, outlier budget, and packing per layer automatically -- no Hessian, no calibration data, no manual bit-width selection. Each weight matrix is decomposed into a sparse fp16 outlier residual and a dense sub-byte index tensor into a per-group learned codebook. Two storage modes share one auto-select frontend and one fused decode kernel: V2 (per-channel Lloyd) and V2a (shared library of L=32 codebooks per layer). On Qwen3.5-122B-A10B under V2, XFP reaches 138 tok/s single-stream decode on workstation hardware (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, TP=2) at 94.49% GSM8K strict-match (3 seeds, n=3957), and is 49% faster than Marlin INT4 at TP=1. For models that do not fit in the target memory envelope, we present the H-Process: a quality-driven iteration over the two cosine thresholds that finds the operating point at which the model just fits while still producing sensible output. Three constraints define its search space: the operator-set thresholds, an OOM boundary at quantize-on-load, and a garbage boundary in generation (cosine similarity steers; benches verify). On Qwen3.5-397B-A17B (512 routed experts/layer), the H-Process fits the full expert population into 2x96 GB at ~3.4 effective bits and delivers 100.9 tok/s long-output decode at 66.72% GSM8K strict-match on the full 1319-problem set (single seed at submission; multi-seed evaluation in progress), exceeding INT4 with routed-expert pruning on memory, throughput, and accuracy simultaneously.
