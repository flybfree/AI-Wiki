# Reasoning-Token Spikes Under Prompted Untruthful Responding in Large Language Models

## Abstract
Monitoring the chain-of-thought of reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) models remains a key approach to detecting deception and other forms of misbehavior in such models. However, semantic chain-of-thought monitoring depends on reasoning traces being legible and sufficiently faithful to the underlying computations that produced the model's behavior, not to mention accessible. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that chain-of-thought outputs may soon become illegible or unfaithful, if they even remain accessible. Based on cognitive load theory, we investigate a lower-bandwidth signal -- the number of reasoning tokens generated -- which does not require access to the content of the reasoning trace. Three reasoning-capable large language models answered 210 multiple-choice questions -- across analytic, descriptive, and normative reasoning types as well as moral and non-moral domains -- under system prompts instructing them to respond truthfully, falsely, or without regard for truth. Across all three models, truth-directed responding elicited fewer reasoning tokens than both lie-directed and truth-indifferent responding. These findings show that explicitly prompted untruthful response policies can produce robust group-level differences in test-time reasoning-token use. While not yet establishing reasoning-token count as a detector of spontaneous deception or general misalignment, our results are a proof of concept that it can serve as a simple, content-independent candidate signal for differentiating untruthful from truthful model behavior when raw reasoning traces are unavailable or unreliable. Future work should test instance-level detection rates, out-of-distribution generalization, learned deceptive policies, hidden objectives, and robustness under adversarial pressure.
