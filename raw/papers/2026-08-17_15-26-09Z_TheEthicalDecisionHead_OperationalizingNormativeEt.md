# The Ethical Decision Head: Operationalizing Normative Ethics in Autonomous Vehicles via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback

## Abstract
As autonomous vehicles (AVs) approach Level 4 and Level 5 operational capability [SAE International, 2018], their on- board decision systems must handle not only safety-critical locomotion but also their subsequent moral weight. This paper details the Ethical Decision Head (EDH), a deep re- inforcement learning (RL) framework that encodes ethical reasoning as a differentiable reward signal, enabling a pol- icy gradient agent to learn morally-aligned driving behavior in scenarios whose state representation is aligned with the CARLA simulation environment [Dosovitskiy et al., 2017]. Two normative frameworks are instantiated and evaluated: a Utilitarian framework minimizing total casualties and a Kan- tian framework enforcing course maintenance as a categori- cal imperative. The EDH is trained via Proximal Policy Op- timization (PPO) [Schulman et al., 2017] against a Bradley- Terry reward model [Bradley and Terry, 1952] learned from pairwise human preference annotations over 200 collision- imminent scenarios. Results reveal an asymmetry in the learnability of normative ethical frameworks under human su- pervision. The Kantian condition, which reduces to a con- stant prediction task under the codebook, serves as a pipeline control: it confirms training stability and rules out infrastruc- ture failure as an explanation for the utilitarian result. The Utilitarian agent learned something more unsettling: human raters rewarded self-sacrifice over casualty minimization, and the model learned that preference faithfully. This divergence between what humans prescribe in theory and what they re- ward in practice suggests that RLHF does not learn ethics as philosophers define it, but as humans live it.
