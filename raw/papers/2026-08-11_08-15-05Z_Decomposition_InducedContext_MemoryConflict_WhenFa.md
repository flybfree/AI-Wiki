# Decomposition-Induced Context-Memory Conflict: When Fact-Checking Pipelines Contradict Their Own Source Text

## Abstract
Decompose-then-verify pipelines, including FActScore-style fact-checkers and long-form factuality evaluators, first split a passage into atomic claims before checking each one. Decomposition itself is treated as a neutral preprocessing step. We show it is not: a decomposer can be induced to substitute its own parametric belief for what the source passage says, producing a claim that contradicts the text it was supposed to summarize faithfully. We call this Decomposition-Induced Context-Memory Conflict (DI-CC) and show it is mechanistically the same phenomenon as classical context-memory conflict, occurring inside a different pipeline stage than prior work has examined. A linear probe trained only on classical context-memory conflict data (NQ-Swap), never exposed to any decomposition output, significantly separates decomposition positions that produce DI-CC from faithful decompositions (AUC = 0.86-0.88, permutation p < 0.0005). An existing reference-free baseline, SelfCheckGPT-style self-consistency sampling, fails to detect DI-CC at all (AUC 0.51, chance-level), because DI-CC content is stably recoverable and recurs across resamples, unlike the variability self-consistency methods rely on. Context-aware decoding, a training-free mitigation from the classical setting, transfers to decomposition and suppresses DI-CC, but at a severe cost: many decompositions under coreference-heavy conditions fail to parse, often because the decomposer fabricates a different identity. We do not consider this mitigation deployment-ready. We further characterize the mechanism's boundaries: its natural occurrence rate is too sparss not manifest on naturally-occurring hallucinatedtext, and it requires a minimum model scale to detecablish DI-CC as a real, mechanistically grounded, andpartially treatable failure mode, with a scope we chhan overstate.
