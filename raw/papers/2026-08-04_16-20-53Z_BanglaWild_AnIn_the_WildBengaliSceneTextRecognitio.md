# BanglaWild: An In-the-Wild Bengali Scene Text Recognition Benchmark for OCR and Vision-Language Models

## Abstract
In-the-wild Bengali scene text recognition is largely unmeasured: existing resources target handwritten documents or constrained sign-board parsing, report only aggregate edit-distance metrics, and evaluate either conventional OCR or VLMs, never both on the same in-the-wild data. To address this gap, we introduce BANGLAWILD, a benchmark of 2,535 Bengali scene text images, each paired with a verbatim gold transcription, two categorical axes, four diagnostic attributes, and an orthographically standard form where the in-image text deviates from canonical spelling. We evaluate fifteen VLMs and three conventional OCR systems under three prompting strategies, fine-tune 6 open-source models with LoRA, and complement edit-distance metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. Our results reveal a persistent gap in which larger models within the same family do not outperform smaller ones. Our fifteen-class error taxonomy shows that visual mis-recognition accounts for ~60% of errors in the strongest systems, while conjunct-related errors contribute under 2%, challenging a long-standing assumption in Bengali OCR research; the same visual dominant profile also holds across architectures, including the one conventional baseline that reads Bengali reliably. Prompt language mainly affects cross-script drift and LoRA reduces catastrophic failures in weak models without lifting the ceiling on already competent ones. Code and data will be publicly released.
