# Robust Wavelength Selection for Partial Least Squares Sugar Content Estimation Using Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization

## Abstract
Wavelength selection is one of the important preprocessing methods in near-infrared spectroscopy to improve prediction accuracy and interpretability of spectral data. We formulate wavelength-region selection for sugar content estimation as a binary black-box optimization problem and propose a method based on Bayesian optimization. The proposed method constructs a sparse quadratic surrogate model and sequentially extracts interested wavelength regions by Thompson sampling. Minimizing an acquisition function is performed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem by simulated or quantum annealing. Experiments show that the proposed method improves the prediction accuracy of partial least squares regression and yields more consistent wavelength regions than genetic-algorithm-based selection and simulated annealing. Under one-bit local perturbations, the selected wavelength regions show minimal fluctuations in root mean square errors between observed and predicted values of a validation set. This local stability suggests that our method converges to a smoother error landscape and avoids isolated overfitted solutions. These results indicate that combinatorial Bayesian optimization is a useful framework for robust feature selection in spectroscopic prediction tasks.
