# ALPS: Measuring Valid Creativity in Large Language Models with Mathematical Construction

## Abstract
Large language models produce outputs presented as discoveries - new proofs, conjectures, or molecules. Whether such an output that appears creative is truly original and effective is hard to establish: open-ended outputs require subjective judgment, the output may replicate something seen in training, or the task may be too simple to need creativity. We present ALPS (Austin-Law Proof-Synthesis), a benchmark that designs a task to measure valid creativity: producing a solution that is original and can be proven correct. Each instance is a single equational law, certified to require either the construction of an infinite mathematical structure satisfying the law, or a proof that no such structure exists. Submissions are verified by automated proof checking with no human involvement, and a public generator produces new instances without limit, so LLMs are never evaluated on problems they may have seen. A portfolio of eight configurations of leading automated provers resolves 2.2% of the 4,141-law evaluation pool, and a twentyfold budget increase adds 0.6%: the obstacle is not compute, but the absence of any method that produces the tailored structure each law requires. Under a fixed protocol, the strongest reasoning model we test succeeds in 14% of instances on the proof side, but none on the construction side. The remaining 97.2% of the pool is unresolved at every configuration and budget we test. We release ALPS in full: the corpus, the generator, and the automated judge.
