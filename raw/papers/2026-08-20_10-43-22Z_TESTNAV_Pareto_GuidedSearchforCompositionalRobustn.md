# TESTNAV: Pareto-Guided Search for Compositional Robustness Testing

## Abstract
Deep learning models remain vulnerable to real-world input perturbations, especially when multiple corruptions co-occur in the same input (e.g., brightness shifts and motion blur). Compositional testing reveals these interaction effects but introduces two challenges: combinatorial growth of the perturbation space as dimensions and severity levels increase, and uneven diagnostic value-many combinations yield unrealistically degraded inputs with limited practical relevance.   We present TESTNAV, 1 a Pareto-guided robustness testing framework for efficiently exploring discrete, compositional perturbation spaces when only a limited number of perturbation configurations can be evaluated. TESTNAV prioritises severe yet realistic failures by formulating robustness testing as bi-objective optimisation: maximise performance degradation while preserving input fidelity measured by modality-specific metrics (e.g., SSIM and KID for vision; chrF and BERT-F1 for language and code). It uses NSGA-II to approximate the bi-objective Pareto front. Across four benchmarks spanning vision, natural language, and code generation, TESTNAV recovers Pareto fronts up to 2.15x faster than search-based baselines, using 35.8%-89.3% of the discrete perturbation space defined by four perturbation dimensions with six levels each.
