# ADEx-FNO: A Unified Ambient-Domain Framework for Fourier Neural Operators on Varying Geometries

## Abstract
Fourier neural operators (FNOs) provide efficient nonlocal spectral learning, but varying geometries and independently chosen discretizations remain difficult to accommodate. We introduce the ambient-domain extension Fourier neural operator (ADEx-FNO), a deterministic framework that incorporates geometry without modifying the defining Fourier-operator layers. Each physical domain is embedded in a fixed ambient hypercube and represented by a signed distance function. Inputs and solution fields are deterministically extended to the ambient domain, transferred to a common, potentially nonuniform rectilinear latent grid, processed by the FNO, then interpolated to an independently chosen target discretization and restricted to the physical domain. All geometry-transfer operations lie outside the optimization procedure and require no trainable graph, point-cloud, deformation, or geometry-decoding modules.   ADEx-FNO achieves relative l2 errors of 0.32%-0.77% on held-out smooth-domain nonlinear Poisson and advection-reaction-diffusion problems in 2D and 3D, and is also evaluated on unseen nonsmooth geometries. A single ADEx-FNO inference is then used to initialize conventional CFD solvers. For all 29 converged 2D and 3D RANS cases, pseudo-time iterations decrease, with mean reductions of 44.17% and 43.03%, respectively, with comparable gains across three mesh resolutions. URANS cases reduce post-window physical-time advances by 18.52%-27.51%. In transfer from 2D URANS training data to DNS at different Mach and Reynolds numbers, the bootstrap interval decreases by 23.47%-48.21%, depending on the target statistic. In all CFD tests, ADEx-FNO provides only the initial field; the governing-equation solver controls the subsequent solution, while physical or statistical consistency is assessed separately from computational savings.
