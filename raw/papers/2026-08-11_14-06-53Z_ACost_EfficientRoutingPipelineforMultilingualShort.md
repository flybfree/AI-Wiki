# A Cost-Efficient Routing Pipeline for Multilingual Short-Text Classification Using Small Language Models

## Abstract
Multilingual short-text classification supports operational systems such as content moderation, customer support routing, and intent recognition, yet aggregate evaluation often hides large differences between high-resource and low-resource languages. Uniform inference policies are simple to deploy, but they assume that all languages are equally well served. In this work, we evaluate a fixed-list routing strategy that keeps stronger languages on a direct multilingual path and selectively sends weaker languages through translation into English before zero-shot classification. The pipeline is fully self-hosted, uses pretrained compact sentence encoders, and requires no task-specific fine-tuning.   We test the approach on two benchmarks chosen to differ in scale and label granularity: a 15-language subset of SIB-200 for seven-way topic classification and a 15-locale subset of MASSIVE for intent classification over an official 60-intent inventory. On SIB-200, the best overall configuration is R1, which translates only the low-resource tier: high-tier and mid-tier Macro-F1 remain unchanged, while low-tier Macro-F1 rises from 0.4632 to 0.6828. On the MASSIVE subset, the same low-tier intervention raises low-tier Macro-F1 from 0.2143 to 0.4417, but the best overall result is obtained by full translation, R3, at Macro-F1 0.4647. Across these two benchmarks, selective translation is a reliable intervention for weaker languages, whereas the optimal routing boundary depends on the task. We therefore report routing through tier-level quality gains and tier-level latency rather than a single global efficiency score.
