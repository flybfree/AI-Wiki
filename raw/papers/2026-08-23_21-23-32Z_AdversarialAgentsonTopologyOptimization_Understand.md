# Adversarial Agents on Topology Optimization: Understanding the Fragility and Robustness of Deep Learning-based and Physics-Based Design Models under Adversarial Perturbation

## Abstract
Topology optimization, using both physic-based approaches and deep learning surrogates, serves as a cornerstone for generative design agents in cyber-manufacturing systems. While deep learning surrogates have gained widespread adoption due to their speed in online design generation, this work demonstrates their vulnerability under input perturbations. In this work, we present a mechanics-grounded reliability evaluation framework that formulates an adversarial agent targeting the generative design models. We investigate a strictly non-intrusive threat model where bounded perturbations are introduced exclusively to the initial-density channel, while physical boundary conditions, compliance-gradient channels, network architectures, and solver routines remain intact. Evaluating surrogate models across U-Net, convolutional, and generative architectures with varying physics-gradient conditioning depths demonstrates that bounded initialization noise can cause catastrophic mechanical failure, increasing compliance by multiple orders of magnitude through severed load paths and disconnected supports. Furthermore, we discover that incorporating richer physics-gradient conditioning in the deep learning surrogates does not guarantee monotonic robustness across surrogate families. Finally, physics-in-the-loop recovery demonstrates that initializing the classical SIMP optimizer with perturbed topologies mitigates design performance degradation, having a high probability of restoring compliance to near-baseline levels across tested instances. These findings demonstrate that learned surrogates should serve as physics-verified initializers instead of replacing physics-based solvers entirely in a resilient cyber-manufacturing system. Moreover, the proposed adversarial agent provides a foundation for future training generative design agents robust against noise and targeted perturbations.
