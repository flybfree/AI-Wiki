# FAST-DeepONet: Factor-Augmented Branch Representations for High-Dimensional PDE Inputs in the Small-Sample Regime

## Abstract
Deep operator networks can become statistically unstable when partial differential equation inputs are observed at thousands of strongly correlated sensors but only a small number of operator samples is available. We introduce FAST-DeepONet, a branch representation combining a fixed spectral path with a regularized projection of the orthogonal residual, in which the directional penalty acts on the effective residual map after each of its rows is normalized. On Navier--Stokes flow a plain DeepONet degrades from $0.0394$ to $0.1556$ mean relative $L_2$ error as the branch grows from $129$ to $8193$ coordinates, while FAST-DeepONet stays near $0.04$, so the sensor grid can be refined without a statistical penalty. Across independent test sets for Navier--Stokes flow, Darcy flow, and signed terminal wavefield prediction it lowers mean relative $L_2$ error by $4.7\%$ to $37.0\%$ with three to seven times fewer trainable parameters. A spectral-only branch sharing the same basis separates the two paths: the fixed spectral path carries the improvement on Navier--Stokes and Darcy, while terminal wave prediction requires the residual path together with its directional penalty. FAST-DeepONet targets coordinate-query architectures and trains on solution values alone.
