# The Blind Spot in 2D Infants' Pose Estimation:Robust Learning from Noisy Annotations

## Abstract
Noisy annotations pose a significant challenge for supervised deep learning, as neural networks rely on large-scale, high-quality labeled data whose corruption can severely impair model performance. Although robustness to label noise has been extensively studied for classification tasks, it remains relatively underexplored in Pose Estimation (PE). This limitation becomes critical in clinical contexts, including neonatology, where PE of preterm infants is used to support the assessment of spontaneous motility, a key indicator of neurodevelopmental trajectories. In such settings, infants' images labeling is further hindered by visual challenges (e.g., keypoint self-occlusions, caregiver interference), making the annotation process inherently susceptible to errors. To tackle noisy annotations in PE, we introduce REliable keypoint selection via Memory of traINing Dynamics (REMIND), a clustering-based keypoint-selection strategy that exploits keypoint-wise training dynamics to identify noisy labels without assuming any prior knowledge of the noise distribution, thus enabling noise-free model training. When evaluated on the proprietary NeoPose dataset, comprising 46 videos of 46 preterm infants recorded in real clinical settings, REMIND correctly identifies noisy annotations across multiple corruption scenarios, achieving up to 93\% Area Under the Curve (AUC) with three different PE architectures used in the relevant literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly address label noise in preterm infants' PE, paving the way for the design of trustworthy learning-based algorithms for infants'monitoring support when data quality cannot be guaranteed.
