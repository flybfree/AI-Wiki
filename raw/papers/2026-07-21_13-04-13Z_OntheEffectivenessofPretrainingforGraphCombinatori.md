# On the Effectiveness of Pretraining for Graph Combinatorial Optimization

## Abstract
This paper introduces a self-supervised pretraining framework for graph combinatorial optimization specifically designed to address the nature of routing problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem. By utilizing graph contrastive learning with geometric augmentations (specifically, rotations and axial reflections) the model is forced to learn invariant structural representations and global relative distance distributions. Results demonstrate that this pretraining strategy outperforms non-pretrained models across various problem scales. Notably, the hybrid strategy (combining rotation and reflection) achieved a 6.57% improvement in tour length for TSP1000, proving that geometric pretraining is an important inductive bias for effectively scaling neural solvers to high-dimensional instances.
