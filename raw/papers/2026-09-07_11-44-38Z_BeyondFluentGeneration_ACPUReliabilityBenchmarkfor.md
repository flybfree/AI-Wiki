# Beyond Fluent Generation: A CPU Reliability Benchmark for MCP-Style Tool Calling in Sub-2B Small Language Models for Edge Deployment

## Abstract
Resource constrained single-board computers including Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Arduino UNO Q, Orange Pi, and LattePanda motivate on-device small language model (SLM) agents that reduce cloud dependence, improve data locality, and tolerate intermittent connectivity. Model Context Protocol (MCP)-style tool invocation demands more than fluent generation: an agent must emit machine-readable JSON, select the correct tool, supply all required arguments, and avoid unintended actions. We establish a platform-agnostic CPU baseline by evaluating five open-weight models below two billion parameters Phi-1.5, Pythia-1.4B, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, Qwen2.5-0.5B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B on 100 prompts spanning weather retrieval, web search, calculation, email composition, and task creation, under greedy decoding and nucleus sampling. A recovery parser strips Markdown fences, extracts brace-delimited substrings, and scores parseability, tool-name correctness, argument completeness, and value agreement. Under this criterion, Qwen2.5-1.5B achieves 75% (greedy) and 79% (sampling); Qwen2.5-0.5B achieves 72% (greedy) but drops to 32% under sampling. Phi-1.5 scores 0%; Pythia and TinyLlama reach at most 7%. A strict post-hoc audit finds only 5 of 1,000 raw responses directly parseable as JSON, exposing near-total dependence on output recovery. A CPU resource probe shows Qwen2.5-1.5B requires 7,960 MiB and 30.782 s mean latency; Qwen2.5-0.5B uses 3,637 MiB and 10.627 s, revealing a reliability-resource trade-off for edge deployment. These results do not cover the named boards directly or a full MCP implementation. Safe deployment requires schema validation, constrained generation, least-privilege execution, and human escalation for consequential actions.
