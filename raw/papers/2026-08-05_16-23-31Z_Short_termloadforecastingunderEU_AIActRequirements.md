# Short-term load forecasting under EU-AI Act Requirements in Safety-Critical Environments: Results from a 41-day live challenge on the aggregated German transmission-grid load

## Abstract
Short-term load forecasting (STLF) play a vital role in the electric power industry. It serves infrastructure that European and German law designate as critical. Determinism, reproducibility, and auditability are engineering requirements rather than optional extras. STLF is no longer purely an accuracy problem. It is also a software-engineering and compliance problem. This paper describes results from a 41-day live challenge that evaluated a complete STLF pipeline for the aggregated German transmission-grid load. The pipeline is based on the open-source Python library spotforecast2-safe, which implements the EU-AI Act Requirements in Safety-Critical Environments by design. The pipeline predicts the 24 hourly load values of a target day from European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) data. It includes anomaly detection and gap-aware data preparation, calendar and weather covariates, a recursive multi-step forecasting algorithm, and hyperparameter tuning. Forecast accuracy is measured against the official ENTSO-E day-ahead forecast. The EU-AI act compliant spotforecast2-safe pipeline beats the ENTSO-E baseline. In-context models show competitive performance. Transparent, low-cost, and auditable local models (referred to as macl2l in this paper) are competitive with more than 100-million-parameter large, energy-intensive pre-trained foundation models such as chronos-2. The challenge infrastructure, the complete submission history of all teams, and the frozen final leaderboard are publicly available.
