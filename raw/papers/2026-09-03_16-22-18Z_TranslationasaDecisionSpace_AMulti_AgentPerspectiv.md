# Translation as a Decision Space: A Multi-Agent Perspective on Low-Resource Dialect Generation

## Abstract
Neural machine translation (NMT) systems typically produce a single output per input, obscuring the alternative decision trajectories implicitly available within multilingual decoding. This opacity becomes particularly problematic in low-resource dialect settings, where multiple linguistically valid realizations may differ in lexical authenticity, register, and structural stability. We propose reframing translation as a structured decision space explored by autonomous translation agents. Instead of analyzing a single output, we model distinct translation pathways as agents operating over a shared multilingual backbone. Inter-agent divergence is treated not as error but as an interpretable behavioral signal. We conduct an empirical study on Turkish--Syrian Arabic translation using three agents: (1) zero-shot direct translation, (2) dialect-stabilized translation via lightweight fine-tuning, and (3) pivot translation through English. Evaluation is performed on 5,000 dialogue sentences, while stabilization is trained on 5,000 additional Turkish--Syrian sentence pairs drawn from television dialogue and MADAR-Turk resources. Rather than optimizing for conventional performance metrics, we quantify structured behavioral displacement using dialect marker frequency, lexical proximity to standardized Arabic, and structural variance. Lightweight stabilization nearly doubles dialect marker usage, increasing it from 0.2266 to 0.4988, while significantly reducing structural instability. Pivot mediation introduces normalization pressure and measurable compression effects, whereas zero-shot translation exhibits the highest decision variance. We argue that translation divergence across agents reveals latent decision flexibility within multilingual models and we provide a principled interpretability framework for low-resource dialect generation.
