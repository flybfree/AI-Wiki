# A matched-integrator evaluation of Hamiltonian neural networks on pendulum and Kepler dynamics

## Abstract
Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) parameterize conservative dynamics through a learned scalar Hamiltonian, providing an architectural prior that is absent from generic vector-field neural networks. We evaluate this prior under a controlled protocol in which an HNN and a parameter-matched feedforward baseline are trained on the same RK4-generated trajectories, use the same central-difference derivative targets and optimization settings, and are integrated at inference with the same RK4 scheme. Results are reported over five independent training seeds.   On the nonlinear pendulum, the HNN reduces mean energy drift by 42-fold and mean trajectory MSE by 15.8-fold at T = 100, approximately 16 pendulum periods. Its energy drift also remains bounded and exhibits substantially lower seed-to-seed variability than the standard-network baseline. An energy-stratified analysis shows that the difference becomes more pronounced as trajectories explore more nonlinear regions of phase space.   As an additional diagnostic, we examine an explicit Störmer--Verlet-style rollout of the learned HNN. Because the learned Hamiltonian is not constrained to the separable form H(q,p) = T(p) + V(q), the standard symplecticity guarantee of velocity Verlet does not directly apply.   We further apply the same matched-integrator protocol to the three-dimensional Kepler two-body problem. The HNN again exhibits lower trajectory, energy, and angular-momentum drift than the parameter-matched baseline. These experiments provide a controlled study of how Hamiltonian parameterization affects long-horizon prediction and physical consistency across two conservative dynamical systems.
