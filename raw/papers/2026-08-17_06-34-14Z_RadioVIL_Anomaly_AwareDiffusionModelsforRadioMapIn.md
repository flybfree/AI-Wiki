# RadioVIL: Anomaly-Aware Diffusion Models for Radio Map Inpainting and Zero-Shot Vehicle Localization

## Abstract
High-precision radio map construction is essential for emerging 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) applications, including digital twins and intelligent transportation. However, existing deep learning methods predominantly treat this as a pure image completion task, resulting in over-smoothed reconstructions that fundamentally erase high-frequency scattering signatures of dynamic physical entities such as hidden vehicles. To overcome this, we propose RadioVIL, an efficient two-stage framework that reformulates joint radio map inpainting and zero-shot vehicle localization as a prior-guided physical inverse problem. Specifically, we first train a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to capture the structural generative prior of the environment. During inference from highly sparse measurements, we employ a Diffusion-based Mediating Intermediate Layer Optimization (DMILO) algorithm. By optimizing an L1-regularized sparse deviation term, DMILO mathematically isolates vehicle scattering anomalies layer-by-layer without unfolding the entire denoising chain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while conventional reconstruction baselines fail to detect hidden vehicles, and the zero-shot diffusion baseline achieves only limited detection ability due to forced semantic harmonization, RadioVIL preserves authentic physical textures, yielding the best LPIPS of 0.0587 in our evaluation. Uniquely, it unlocks accurate zero-shot vehicle localization directly from sparse radio maps, securing a 75.20% Recall and a 3.31-meter average error, paving a robust way for ISAC at the 6G edge.
