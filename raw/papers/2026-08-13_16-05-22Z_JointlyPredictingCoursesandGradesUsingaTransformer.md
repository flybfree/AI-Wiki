# Jointly Predicting Courses and Grades Using a Transformer-Based Model

## Abstract
Existing predictive models in learning analytics often treat student academic history as a simple sequence, overlooking the concurrent nature of courses taken within a semester. This simplification can lead to inaccurate performance predictions, particularly for students with heavy or challenging course loads. This paper introduces a TRansformer for Academic Course-grade Estimation (TRACE) that addresses this limitation by jointly predicting both the set of courses a student will take and their corresponding grades for an upcoming semester. Our approach encodes courses on a per-semester basis to capture the effects of course concurrency and utilizes a novel loss function combining course-set prediction with grade prediction. We demonstrate that predicting courses taken in addition to the grades in those courses leads to significant improvements in prediction quality. Trained on ten years of institutional data, our joint prediction model reduces mean absolute error by nearly 50% compared to an identical architecture that predicts grades alone. The model also outperforms traditional LSTM-based sequential models, as well as graph neural network-based approaches, and offers natural ways to incorporate student attribute data. This work demonstrates the utility of modern neural architectures for creating interpretable models that can be adapted to new institutions via retraining and recalibration, as well as the importance of key techniques, such as predicting courses taken during training. We discuss how this model could be incorporated into early detection systems at institutions of higher education.
