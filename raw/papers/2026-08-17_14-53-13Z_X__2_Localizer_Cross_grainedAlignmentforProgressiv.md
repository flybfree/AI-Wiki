# X$^2$Localizer: Cross-grained Alignment for Progressive Cross-view Video Geo-localization

## Abstract
Cross-view Video Geo-localization (CVG) aims to localize ground-view videos by retrieving their corresponding geo-tagged aerial images. However, CVG approaches rely on fixed-length inputs and post-hoc refinement, hindering online-oriented localization under partial or dynamic observations. In this work, we formulate Progressive Cross-view Video Geo-localization (PCVG) as a deployment-oriented extension and evaluation protocol of CVG, enabling localization under varying temporal budgets, prefix-based inference, random-start evaluation, and long-range localization with interruptions. To explore PCVG, we introduce X$^2$Localizer, a cross-grained alignment framework that jointly supervises global prefix-to-aerial retrieval and token-aggregated frame--aerial-tile matching with a budget-dependent asymmetric objective. Furthermore, we introduce a Sliding-Window Re-Localization (SWRL) strategy that dynamically refreshes candidate regions for failure recovery and long-range deployment without full-sequence reprocessing. Extensive experiments show that X$^2$Localizer preserves conventional full-video performance, with marginal gains of +0.1 Recall@1 and +0.3 Recall@10, while substantially improving early localization. In the challenging single-frame setting, X$^2$Localizer improves coarse retrieval by +4.7 Recall@1 and +11.5 Recall@10 over the previous state-of-the-art method. With SWRL, our approach further enables robust progressive localization under random-start and long-distance scenarios, narrowing the gap between benchmark evaluation and real-world deployment.
