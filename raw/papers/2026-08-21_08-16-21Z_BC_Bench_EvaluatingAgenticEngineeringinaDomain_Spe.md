# BC-Bench: Evaluating Agentic Engineering in a Domain-Specific Language for ERP

## Abstract
Agentic engineering systems have shown strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks, yet their effectiveness in enterprise resource planning (ERP) domain-specific languages (DSLs) remains underexplored. We introduce BC-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic engineering on real-world tasks in AL, the DSL for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. BC-Bench comprises 101 manually curated tasks extracted from two Microsoft-owned production repositories, reflecting authentic ERP development workflows. Adapting the SWE-Bench methodology, we address the unique constraints of the AL ecosystem---including limited public resources and complex environment provisioning. Beyond generating functional code, BC-Bench evaluates test generation and supports multimodal problem statements where visual context is commonly present. We evaluate multiple frontier models across two agent harnesses, utilizing multi-run metrics to account for nondeterminism. In the Bug Fixing category, under our evaluated settings, between-model differences in resolution rate are larger than differences between the two evaluated agent harnesses, and improvements reported on general-purpose benchmarks do not consistently transfer to AL. These results highlight the need for domain-specific evaluation.
