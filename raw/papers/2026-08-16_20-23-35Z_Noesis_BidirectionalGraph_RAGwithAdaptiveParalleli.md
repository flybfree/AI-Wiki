# Noesis: Bidirectional Graph-RAG with Adaptive Parallelism and Cross-Knowledge-Base Semantic Discovery

## Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation over knowledge graphs (Graph-RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for grounding large language models in domain-specific corpora. However, existing systems face persistent limitations: (1) static chunking fragments long documents, losing cross-section semantic connections; (2) ingestion pipelines do not scale adaptively; and (3) multi-domain deployments require either a monolithic knowledge base that dilutes retrieval precision or manual user routing. We present Noesis, a decoupled Graph-RAG architecture addressing these limitations through four algorithms: (a) Bidirectional Graph Traversal with a Graph-Feedback Context Resolver simulating human reading with degrading memory; (b) an AIMD Concurrency Controller adapted from TCP congestion control, achieving 23x speedup with zero OOM events; (c) Moesis, domain-aware selective quantization for MoE models achieving 6.3x speedup on 12 GB consumer GPUs; and (d) Mesh, cross-KB semantic routing with runtime structural discovery enabling small on-premises models to perform multi-hop cross-domain reasoning. On HotpotQA (1,000 questions), Noesis achieves 59.5 EM / 74.7 F1, surpassing GraphRAG by +27.8 EM while using a 35B on-premises model for graph construction rather than GPT-4o. Source text verification on a 193-page document confirms 90% precision on long-range causal edges inaccessible to chunk-independent extraction.
