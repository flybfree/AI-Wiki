# CosmosAlign: Adapting a World Foundation Model for Generative Traffic Video Forecasting

## Abstract
Generative traffic video forecasting aims to synthesize long-horizon, temporally coherent future videos of traffic scenes from a short observation history and textual descriptions. In this paper, we present CosmosAlign, a generative traffic video forecasting framework built upon the pretrained Cosmos3-Nano world foundation model. Our approach is motivated by the observation that successfully adapting large pretrained world models to downstream forecasting tasks depends primarily on distribution alignment rather than increased model capacity. To this end, we propose a two-stage LoRA adaptation strategy that first aligns the conditioning-mode distribution with the target forecasting task, and then aligns the training captions with the model's native structured prompting interface through an LLM-based re-captioning pipeline. During inference, we further improve prediction quality using a fully training-free procedure consisting of consensus-based medoid sample selection and motion-adaptive blending of static scene regions. CosmosAlign achieves a final score of 76.49 on the AI City Challenge 2026 Track 5 benchmark, ranking first on the final leaderboard. Our code is publicly available at https://quangminhdinh.github.io/CosmosAlign/.
