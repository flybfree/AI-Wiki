# Convolutional Sparse Coding via the Locally Competitive Algorithm on Loihi 2

## Abstract
Sparse coding provides a principled framework for signal representation by expressing an input as a linear combination of only a small number of basis functions. The Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) is particularly attractive in the context of neuromorphic computing because its dynamics, leaky integration, thresholding, and lateral inhibition map naturally to neuromorphic hardware. While prior work has studied non-convolutional LCA on Loihi 2, the convolutional setting is of particular interest because it introduces spatial structure, weight sharing, overlapping receptive fields, and scaling behavior that are more representative of practical sparse inference workloads. In this work, we present a Loihi 2 implementation of convolutional sparse coding via the LCA and evaluate it against a conventional GPU baseline on the same inference problems. The implementation follows a one-layer recurrent LCA formulation and extends it to convolutional feature maps with local inhibitory kernels derived from pairwise filter interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation and benchmark of convolutional LCA on Loihi 2. Our goal is not only to demonstrate feasibility, but also to clarify in which operating regimes convolutional sparse inference becomes attractive on neuromorphic hardware. The resulting study positions convolutional LCA as a useful benchmark for structured sparse inference on emerging neuromorphic systems.
