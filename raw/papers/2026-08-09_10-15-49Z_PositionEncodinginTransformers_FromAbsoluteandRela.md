# Position Encoding in Transformers: From Absolute and Relative Methods to Rotary Position Embeddings and Long-Context Scaling

## Abstract
Self-attention models content-dependent interactions between tokens but does not by itself encode token order. Position encoding addresses this limitation by introducing absolute coordinates, relative distances, or position-dependent rotations into Transformer representations and attention scores. This technical survey develops a unified account of sinusoidal and learned absolute position embeddings, Shaw-style relative position representations, Transformer-XL, T5 relative position bias, ALiBi, and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). We derive how RoPE converts absolute position indices into relative phase differences in Query-Key inner products and compare these methods in terms of where position is injected, computational cost, compatibility with KV caching, and length extrapolation. We then examine long-context extensions, including Position Interpolation, RoPE scaling laws, NTK-aware scaling, Dynamic NTK, NTK-by-parts, YaRN, LongRoPE, and LongRoPE2, with emphasis on frequency allocation, attention rescaling, training length, and target context length. We also summarize implementation considerations, evaluation protocols, and position-encoding choices in representative large language models. A central conclusion is that the ability to compute positional features beyond the training length does not imply reliable long-context generalization; context extension must be evaluated through short-context retention, position-wise perplexity, retrieval, reasoning, and long-context code tasks.
