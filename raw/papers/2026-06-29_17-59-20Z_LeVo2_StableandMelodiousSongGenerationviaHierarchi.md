# LeVo 2: Stable and Melodious Song Generation via Hierarchical Representation Modeling and Progressive Post-Training

## Abstract
Full-length song generation must preserve coherence and musicality, render detailed vocal and accompaniment acoustics, and follow lyrics and prompts. Existing language model-based systems face a structural trade-off: mixed-token modeling preserves vocal-instrument coordination but obscures track-specific details, whereas dual-track prediction improves acoustics but requires longer sequences and weakens global planning. We present LeVo 2, a hybrid LLM-Diffusion framework for controllable full-length song generation. LeVo 2 formulates this trade-off as hierarchical modeling: LeLM first predicts mixed tokens for semantic planning, then predicts vocal and accompaniment tokens in parallel for track-specific refinement, while a diffusion-based Music Codec reconstructs full-length waveforms. A central contribution of this extended version is an aesthetics-guided training schedule for alignment. During pre-training, an automated music aesthetic evaluation framework assigns musicality-tier conditions to large-scale data, providing musicality priors before preference alignment. Progressive post-training applies SFT, large-scale offline DPO, and closed-loop semi-online DPO to separately improve generation quality, controllability, and musicality. Modular extension then trains the Track-Specific LM for acoustic refinement while preserving the aligned semantic planner. This schedule separates musicality learning, controllability alignment, and acoustic refinement, mitigating optimization conflict and the limitations of static offline preference pairs. Expert listening tests and objective evaluations show that LeVo 2 outperforms open-source baselines across six subjective dimensions, and approaches leading commercial systems on several listening metrics. Ablations validate the effects of the training strategy, aesthetics guidance, scaling, and hierarchical architecture.
