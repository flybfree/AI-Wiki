# BioVLN: A Simulation Platform for Visual Language Navigation in Biomedical Laboratories

## Abstract
Biomedical laboratory robots must navigate to instruments before performing experimental procedures. Existing embodied navigation platforms are designed for household environments and treat a target as an object center or an arbitrary nearby position. This representation is inadequate for laboratory instruments, which must be approached from their operating side while maintaining safe clearance from surrounding equipment. We introduce BioVLN, a simulation platform for developing and evaluating visual-language navigation agents in biomedical laboratories. BioVLN represents each instrument with three regions: its physical body, a surrounding clearance region, and an operation area in front of the usable side. This model is applied consistently to scene generation, target placement, navigation evaluation, and safety analysis, so success depends on reaching a position from which the instrument can be accessed. BioVLN supports procedural scene generation and manually designed environments, producing 47 scenes and 1667 episodes. Standardized navigation and reinforcement-learning interfaces enable trajectory collection and policy training. Experiments show that geometric exploration reaches 74.4--87.5% success, while sampling multiple valid positions in the operation area improves success to 83.3--92.5% and reduces unsafe proximity.
