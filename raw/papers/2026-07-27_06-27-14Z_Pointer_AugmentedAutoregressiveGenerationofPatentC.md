# Pointer-Augmented Autoregressive Generation of Patent Claims with Joint Topology and Content Decoding

## Abstract
Autoregressive decoders emit flat token sequences and cannot enforce hierarchical constraints across output segments, a limitation that becomes acute in patent claim generation, where a claim set forms a dependency forest whose scope must narrow monotonically with depth. Topology and content are mutually dependent: a dependent claim's wording must reflect its parent's scope, yet the parent must be chosen before that wording exists, so neither post-hoc parsing nor grammar-constrained decoding suffices. We propose SPG (Structure-aware Patent Generation), which predicts topology inside the autoregressive pass. A pointer head selects each dependent claim's parent, and its gradients, together with a depth-adaptive scope regularizer, reshape the shared decoder's representations during training. A second stage then applies a violation-weighted preference objective over self-generated deficient candidates, supplying the negative signal that granted-patent corpora lack. On HUPD-DCG, SPG on Llama-3-8B-Instruct recovers 79.0\% of gold parent links, a quantity its training reward never supervises, and raises antecedent consistency from 0.292 to 0.478 over a supervised baseline of equal scale, with expert evaluation corroborating these gains.
