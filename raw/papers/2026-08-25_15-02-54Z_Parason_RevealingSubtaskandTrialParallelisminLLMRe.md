# Parason: Revealing Subtask and Trial Parallelism in LLM Reasoning

## Abstract
Scaling test-time reasoning has substantially improved the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs), but standard autoregressive decoding still executes long reasoning traces sequentially, creating severe latency for difficult tasks (up to days and weeks). Parallel reasoning offers a natural remedy. However, prior systems primarily focus on Subtask Parallelism, where the model learns to decompose a high-level task into smaller chunks that can be solved independently. This approach overlooks another pervasive form of parallelism: Trial Parallelism, where multiple speculative attempts explore, verify, and aggregate competing hypotheses in parallel. In this paper, we introduce Parason, which reveals and learns both forms of parallelism in LLM reasoning. Our analysis identifies Trial Parallelism as the majority of parallelizable reasoning computation (65.5% in DeepSeek-V4's reasoning steps in HLE), and it becomes increasingly dominant on hard problems. Guided by this taxonomy, Parason converts sequential reasoning traces into structured parallel trajectories with a context-free grammar, then trains models with Parallelism-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (PA-GRPO), whose reward jointly balances accuracy, latency, and the two parallelism ratios. At inference time, Parason executes the learned parallel structure through tool calls, translating theoretical savings to real-world wall-clock acceleration. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks including AIME24 and AIME25 show that Parason achieves an average acceleration about 1.7$\times$ while maintaining competitive accuracy.
