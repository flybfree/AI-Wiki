# TomaMMU: A Comprehensive Multimodal Understanding Benchmark for Tomato Leaf Diseases

## Abstract
To address this gap, we introduce TomaMMU, a large-scale Tomato leaf disease MultiModal Understanding dataset, alongside TomaBench, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs on tomato disease understanding. TomaMMU comprises 28,808 high-quality images spanning 15 categories and 213,119 human-annotated visual question-answer pairs, generated through a three-stage pipeline comprising Data Collection, Human Annotation, and Question-Answer Generation. Building on this foundation, TomaBench organizes seven agricultural tasks into a hierarchical three-level taxonomy spanning Basic Perception, Pathology Understanding, and Expert Diagnosis, which together enable systematic evaluation from low-level visual recognition to high-level diagnostic reasoning. The tasks assess visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning, offering a comprehensive view of how well models grasp plant pathology. Our results pronounced gaps in fine-grained recognition and factually grounded reasoning with 14 state-of-the-art VLMs, consistently underperforming on both challenging MCQs and open-ended questions. These results suggest that current VLMs struggle to translate visual perception into reliable diagnostic knowledge, motivating the need for targeted domain adaptation. Simple fine-tuning on TomaMMU substantially narrows this gap, boosting accuracy on challenging MCQs to 96.09%, outperforming recent VLMs, and pointing toward promising directions for future work. All data and code is available in https://huggingface.co/datasets/enalis/TomaMMU.
