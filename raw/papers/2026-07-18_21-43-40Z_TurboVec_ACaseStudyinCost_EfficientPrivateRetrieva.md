# TurboVec: A Case Study in Cost-Efficient Private Retrieval for Enterprise RAG via Codebook-Oblivious Quantization

## Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems increasingly power enterprise LLM applications, yet the vector retrieval layer introduces two underexplored challenges: (1) trained codebook quantizers may expose corpus statistics during index construction, creating a leakage channel in multi-tenant deployments, and (2) post-hoc filtering for tenant isolation degrades recall on selective queries. We study TurboVec, an open-source vector index built on TurboQuant - a codebook-oblivious scalar quantizer requiring no corpus-dependent training. On the DBpedia OpenAI embeddings benchmark (d=1536, 100K-999K vectors), TurboQuant 4-bit outperforms trained FAISS Product Quantization at the same memory budget by 8.5-8.9 percentage points in Recall@5 across all scales. Compared to HNSW (R@5=0.991) and IVF-PQ (R@5=0.840), TurboQuant occupies a distinct design point: higher recall than IVF-PQ without training, at 4-8x less memory than HNSW. Deployed on Snowpark Container Services, TurboVec achieves 11ms median query latency at 100K vectors versus 707ms for warehouse brute-force scan. Kernel-level allowlist filtering maintains 0.86-0.93 Recall@10 across 10-1000 tenant workloads versus 0.09-0.19 for post-filter baselines. Codebook-oblivious design reduces membership inference accuracy to near-random (50.0%) versus 57.3% for PQ codebooks. Limitations include single dataset evaluation, uncompressed HNSW comparison, and privacy evaluation on synthetic data only.
