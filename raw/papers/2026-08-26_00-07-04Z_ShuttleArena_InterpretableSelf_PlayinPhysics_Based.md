# ShuttleArena: Interpretable Self-Play in Physics-Based Badminton

## Abstract
Badminton is a compact but challenging domain for game AI: a player must choose a physically feasible shuttle trajectory, anticipate the opponent's interception, and recover to a court position whose value depends on the opponent's next response. The central challenge is that shot selection and recovery are not separable: the best recovery depends on the shot-induced opponent response, while the value of the shot depends on whether the hitter can cover the reply. This paper presents ShuttleArena, a physics-based singles badminton self-play environment that couples continuous shuttle flight, player interception, structured shot generation, and post-shot recovery. The policy uses role-conditioned outputs: a masked interception choice on receiver turns and a factorized hitter action over shot azimuth, shot elevation, shot speed, and recovery target, enabling interpretable tactical probes. Episodes are single rallies rather than full scored games, and training uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) self-play against a staged checkpoint opponent pool with sparse terminal rally-outcome rewards and a factor-specific recovery update. Evaluation with frozen checkpoint play, controlled tactical probes, recovery ablations, qualitative rollouts, and a human-data sanity check shows competitive improvement together with interpretable opponent-conditioned changes in shot geometry and recovery behavior. The learned policies produce recognizable badminton-like structure while also reflecting the abstractions of the simulator, and the recovery intervention shows that learned recovery behavior is competitively important. These results suggest that physics-based racket sports are a useful testbed for interactive digital entertainment AI because they require agents to coordinate execution, positioning, and opponent-relative tactical value.
