# Trie Automata for Constrained Decoding over Large Finite Sets

## Abstract
Large language models increasingly need to generate structured outputs that conform to predefined schemas, with one common constraint being selection from a finite set of valid strings. Current constrained decoding systems handle this through general-purpose grammar compilation, which becomes prohibitively slow as the number of valid values grows into the thousands, a cardinality wall. We introduce the trie automaton, a specialized mechanism that exploits finite-set structure (shared prefixes, bounded depth, known cardinality) via Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching to precompute per-node token masks. The trie achieves 7X faster per-step valid-token computation (0.65 us vs. 5.8 us) compared to XGrammar, one of the primary backends in vLLM and SGLang, and 2--6.5X faster compilation at K >= 300. Because precomputed masks enable a stateless serving path that bypasses the guided decoding pipeline, this advantage compounds in batch serving: end-to-end vLLM throughput reaches 219 req/s vs. XGrammar's 7.5 req/s at batch size 256 (29X). The 29X combines the algorithmic speedup with integration-path savings that only precomputed masks can unlock. Across seven tokenizer families (32K--262K vocabulary), the trie maintains sub-100ms compilation up to K = 10,000 and flat per-step cost regardless of set size, while guaranteeing 100% output validity.
