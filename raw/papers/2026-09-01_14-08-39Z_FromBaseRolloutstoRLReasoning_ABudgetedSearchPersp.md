# From Base Rollouts to RL Reasoning: A Budgeted Search Perspective

## Abstract
Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves language-model reasoning, but how these gains relate to inference-time decoding and search remains unclear. Does RL create reasoning the base model lacks, or shift the rollout distribution toward trajectories it can already reach but rarely samples? We study this behaviorally with a Unified Decoding Framework (UDF), which expresses token-level sampling, beam-like search, tree search, and sequence-level resampling as executable policies over a shared budgeted operating space, scored post hoc with pass@$k$, self-consistency, best-of-$N$, and first-finish success. Using paired Base/RL checkpoints from SimpleRL-Zoo, we ask whether an RL default-policy curve can be approximated by a structured path of Base operating points. On Math500, AIME, GPQA, and IFEval, the pass@$k$ recovery path follows a Budgeted Operating-Point Transition Rule (BOPTR), $N_{\mathrm{Base}} \approx αN_{\mathrm{RL}}^β$, with benchmark-conditioned exponents. On Qwen2.5-7B, BOPTR gives the lowest transfer error among the non-oracle rules we test, 3.41 pp (95% CI [2.32, 5.53]); a three-seed replication gives 3.07 $\pm$ 0.39 pp. The rule extends to ten models across four families (3.28 to 4.87 pp on checkpoints added after fitting), to four benchmarks it was never fitted on (5.03 pp vs. 4.44 pp in fit), and holds without an RL checkpoint for the target model (4.19 pp) or without RL supervision of any kind (5.08 pp). These results support a qualified internalized-search reading: under the recipe we test, much of the measured RL gain corresponds to a change in sampling efficiency toward operating points the base model can already reach under search. We treat the scaling patterns as descriptive of this recipe and cohort, report where they break down, and use UDF and BOPTR as behavioral diagnostics rather than evidence of parameter-level equivalence.
