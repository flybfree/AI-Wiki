# REFACTOR-VLA: Unsupervised Library Learning of Typed Motor Programs

## Abstract
Most vision-language-action (VLA) models -- OpenVLA, $π_0$, RT-2, RDT-1B -- are monolithic: they emit raw motor commands or short action chunks without organizing behavior into reusable abstractions, so they degrade on long-horizon tasks and resist interpretation. Existing skill-discovery methods sidestep the core question of when two action sequences are behaviorally equivalent, either clustering contrastive embeddings or delegating the judgment to a language model uncalibrated to the robot's dynamics. We introduce REFACTOR-VLA, a wake/sleep system for learning reusable skills. Its sleep phase clusters motor-program fragments under a Behavioral-Equivalence Kernel (BEK) computed from rollouts of a learned latent world model $M_φ$; its wake phase emits typed lambda terms over a Hindley--Milner-inspired vocabulary, consumed by a library-conditioned rectified-flow action decoder. Abstractions are admitted only if they pass Minimum Description Length and return-preservation gates. On LIBERO we report two findings. First, enlarging the world model from 188M to 430M parameters worsened performance on 4 of 4 suites, so capacity alone does not help. Second, the training objective matters far more: adding an auxiliary supervised contrastive (InfoNCE) loss during world-model warmup substantially improves sleep-phase clustering, giving Normalized Mutual Information at $n=3$ seeds of $0.462 \pm 0.021$ (object), $0.867 \pm 0.025$ (spatial), $0.915 \pm 0.013$ (goal) and $0.754 \pm 0.010$ (LIBERO-10), and beating the strongest published baseline on all 4 suites by a mean $Δ= +0.184$. Across providers ($n=12$) the 95% bootstrap confidence interval for mean pairwise NMI is $[0.683, 0.729]$ (mean $0.705$). The sleep phase also yields the first real-LIBERO task-language library: the decoder uses 2 of 3 admitted abstractions and rewrites all 256 sampled demonstrations.
