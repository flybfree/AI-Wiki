# FDE-Bench: Evaluating LLM Agents for Deployment Environment Configuration

## Abstract
Deployment requires an agent to turn application code into a running system whose services connect, become ready, and remain observable. FDE-Bench evaluates this capability with 136 deployment-configuration tasks spanning Docker images, multi-service Compose stacks, and Kubernetes, in greenfield and diagnose-and-repair modes. Agents submit declarative artifacts that are collected, rebuilt, and redeployed in a pristine environment. Four gated binary check layers measure build, readiness, behavior, and conformance to the deployment specification, using programmatic checks without an LLM judge. A four-arm release gate requires a resolving reference solution and rejects tasks solved by do-nothing, specification-transcription, or generic-stub submissions. The released check annotations expose the link between 2,145 checks and their specifications, including seven documented gaps. Three additional adversarial strategies test shortcuts in the grading signals; none resolves any of the 135 tasks they cover, while a vacuous health probe passes readiness and exposes the need for downstream checks. On the 136-task evaluation grid, seven language models from four providers use the same four-tool scaffold and resolve 52.9-75.0 percent of tasks. The three zero-intelligence floors resolve none and reach a mean Deployment Score of at most 0.44. Readiness is the largest failure stage, accounting for 110 of 313 unresolved episodes. Mean resolution rate is 30.7 percentage points higher on the repair task group than on the disjoint greenfield group, with a positive gap for every model; ten tasks resist all seven. In a 25-task case study, one practicing engineer directing Claude-Sonnet-5 resolves 92 percent against 72 percent for the autonomous baseline. FDE-Bench links deployment success and failure to artifacts that can be inspected and replayed.
