# FilmWorld: Agentic Novel-to-Film Generation through Dynamic Cinematic World Modeling

## Abstract
Translating novels into films poses a grand challenge for generative artificial intelligence, requiring conversion of abstract literary prose into long-form, multi-scene visual narratives. While current video generation models excel at short, single-scene clips within narrow temporal and spatial contexts, novel-to-film generation operates in a more complex regime, demanding long-duration content across diverse scenes with dynamically evolving entity states. To address this, we formalize novel-to-film generation as dynamic cinematic world modeling, decomposed into two phases: construction, which grounds abstract, underspecified literary narratives into concrete, stateful, and persistent world entities; and evolution, which governs how these entities dynamically update under plot progression to maintain causal consistency across scenes. We propose FilmWorld, an end-to-end agentic system where two groups of specialized agents collaborate to instantiate these phases. Construction-side agents perform narrative structured translation, world entity state modeling with visual anchoring, and state-driven shot planning, progressively projecting literary language into a cinematic blueprint. Evolution-side agents perform state-anchored visual generation, cross-shot dynamic state propagation, and closed-loop state verification to maintain causal consistency and visual coherence. To address the evaluation gap in long-form generation, we introduce FilmEval, a systematic evaluation framework that couples a difficulty-graded benchmark of 15 representative novels with an automated protocol of nine objective metrics spanning three dimensions: cinematic presentation, film consistency, and novel fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that FilmWorld consistently outperforms state-of-the-art video generation agent systems, with particularly pronounced improvements in narrative fidelity and cross-scene consistency.
