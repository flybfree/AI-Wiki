# ChronoState: Hidden Elapsed-Time Conditioning for Temporal-State Action Selection in Frozen-Backbone Language Models

## Abstract
Temporal decisions in language-model systems often depend on both symbolic task state and elapsed wall-clock time, such as cache expiration, job completion, quota resets, deadlines, or stale sessions. We study whether elapsed time can be supplied as a non-token, system-side scalar and composed with visible symbolic state by a frozen-backbone language model. We introduce ChronoState, a compositional temporal-state benchmark in which symbolic state appears in the prompt, elapsed seconds tau are supplied through a hidden chronometric-injection channel, and the model selects a forced-choice temporal action. Here, "hidden" means hidden from the user-visible token sequence, not from model computation. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct as a frozen bf16 backbone with a 31-dimensional sinusoidal-plus-log time encoding, gated FiLM residual modulation, and a rank-8 LoRA action surface, hidden-time CI reaches 0.9305 +/- 0.0134 accuracy and 0.9410 +/- 0.0103 balanced accuracy. No-time and shuffled-time controls fall to 0.5511 +/- 0.0042 and 0.3323 +/- 0.0097, respectively, with high shuffled-time wrong-state consistency supporting causal dependence on the injected scalar within the trained distribution. Generalization remains strong for held-out templates, durations, and multi-constraint compositions, but held-out quota-family transfer is weak at 0.5065 +/- 0.0559, while a fair prompt+LoRA timestamp baseline reaches 0.9893 +/- 0.0052. Thus, ChronoState supports a narrow conclusion: hidden elapsed time can be composed with symbolic task state under direct supervision, but does not establish autonomous time tracking, broad unseen-family abstraction, or superiority over prompt-injected timestamps.
