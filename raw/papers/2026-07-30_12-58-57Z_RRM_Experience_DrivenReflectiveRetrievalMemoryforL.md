# RRM: Experience-Driven Reflective Retrieval Memory for Long-Horizon Multimodal Reasoning

## Abstract
Existing multimodal long-term memory agents use external memory to overcome the limited context available for long videos. However, most methods emphasize what to store rather than how stored memory should be retrieved. When retrieval becomes inaccurate or repeatedly fails to obtain useful evidence, existing agents lack mechanisms to diagnose failures from previous task trajectories and adapt future search strategies.We introduce Reflective Retrieval Memory (RRM), a reflective memory framework for long-horizon multimodal reasoning. RRM augments an entity-centric multimodal memory graph with reflective experience memory, which distills transferable procedural retrieval knowledge from historical task trajectories. Unlike episodic and semantic memories that preserve factual evidence from the current video, reflective experience memory captures reusable search strategies across tasks. RRM converts retrieved experiences into query-level guidance, while answer generation remains conditioned only on factual evidence newly retrieved from the current video. A lifecycle management mechanism further regulates experience memory through usage frequency, reuse feedback, and temporal decay, thereby reducing redundancy and noise. RRM consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on M3-Bench-Robot, M3-Bench-Web, and Video-MME-Long, demonstrating the effectiveness of reflective retrieval memory for long-horizon multimodal reasoning.
