# Beam Search, Self-Consistency, and the Limits of Inference-Time Scaling for Grammar-Constrained Text-to-SQL in Small Language Models

## Abstract
One common trade-off in the use of large language models involves reducing the size of the model while increasing the amount of computation at inference time, for example by using a wider beam search. In this paper, we examine the constrained case of this "model size vs. inference compute" trade-off, in which the model outputs are constrained by a strict grammar at inference time. Our results demonstrate that the constrained trade-off behaves differently from the unconstrained trade-off. We investigate the task of converting a prose query into an equivalent SQL query (text-to-SQL). Performance is evaluated on the Spider text-to-SQL benchmark, using the Qwen2.5-Instruct model family ranging in size from 0.5B to 7B parameters, all at 4-bit precision. We experiment with two approaches to varying inference compute: (i) beam search with a variable number of beams; and (ii) sample+vote, i.e., sampling several constrained outputs and then voting on their execution results, where the number of samples is varied. On the 1034-example development set, we find that: (a) both beam search and sample+vote improve accuracy, especially on smaller model sizes; (b) the "model size vs.\ inference compute" trade-off is not advantageous in this experiment, because moving to a larger model size typically results in higher accuracy than increasing inference compute on the same model size; (c) beam search outperforms sample+vote at a matched inference budget. This latter result is of particular interest since it contrasts with the findings of the unconstrained trade-off.
