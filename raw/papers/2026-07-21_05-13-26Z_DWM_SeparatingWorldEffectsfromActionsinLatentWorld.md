# DWM: Separating World Effects from Actions in Latent World Models

## Abstract
Latent world models underpin much of modern model-based control, yet current action-conditioned formulations supervise   the next-latent transition with a single, undifferentiated target, forcing a monolithic learning signal to absorb every   source of state change. In real world, however, transitions arise from two heterogeneous sources: an action-driven   component induced by the agent, and an action-invariant world effect -- the change that would still occur under a null   action, dictated by the environment's intrinsic dynamics (e.g., gravity-driven sliding, inertia, contact rebound, and   persistent drift). Fusing them into a single target entangles the two inside the latent transition, prevents the model   from attributing observed changes to their underlying causes, and undermines the transferability of the learned   dynamics. We introduce DWM (Decomposed World Model), a supervision-level framework that operationalizes this   decomposition. DWM augments the predictor of a latent world model with an auxiliary world head, regularized by a   normalized world-contrastive objective to be action-invariant, while the original pred head is coupled to it via an   orthogonality constraint; together, the two signals induce an explicit additive decomposition of the predicted   transition into an action-invariant and a complementary action-driven component, without altering the underlying   architecture or inference pipeline. To evaluate DWM under persistent world effects, we construct W-variants of three   standard control benchmarks -- PushT-W, Reacher-W, and TwoRoom-W -- each instantiating a distinct action-invariant   dynamic. DWM matches strong baselines on the flat counterparts and delivers a mean absolute improvement of 13.1% in CEM   planning success across the W-variants.
