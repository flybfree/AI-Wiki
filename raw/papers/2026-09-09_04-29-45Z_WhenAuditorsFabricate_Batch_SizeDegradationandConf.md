# When Auditors Fabricate: Batch-Size Degradation and Confident Hallucination in LLM Detection of Planted Document Contamination

## Abstract
Large language models are increasingly proposed as automated auditors of document quality, yet their reliability as detectors of planted errors is poorly characterised. We construct a contaminated corpus of 150 academic papers spanning supply chain management and medical research, injecting 450 known contaminants of three types: typographical corruption, semantic reversal, and absurd out-of-context insertion. We then evaluate Google Gemini 3.0 Pro's ability to recover a 180-contaminant answer-key subset across 60 documents under three prompting regimes of increasing scale: single document, small batch, and large batch. Detection holds at small scale and then collapses: 50% recovery on single documents, 60% on small batches, and 2.8% on large batches. The failure mode at scale is not abstention but fabrication. Rather than reporting incomplete processing, the model produced confident findings including invented contaminants of its own, absurdities such as "telepathic squirrel" and "quantum-powered toaster" that mimic the style of the planted material but do not appear in any document. Detection also varies by contamination type: absurd insertions were recovered at 75% in completed evaluations, while semantic reversals and typographical corruptions were each recovered at only 50%. The corruptions most likely to occur in the wild, plausible ones, are the ones most often missed. We conclude that LLM document auditing degrades not gracefully but deceptively, and outline the harness such systems require: bounded batch sizes, direct content injection, and mechanical verification of every reported finding against source text.
