# Beyond Single-Model Injection: A Threat Model and Defense Architecture for Prompt Injection in Multi-Agent Systems

## Abstract
Existing prompt injection research focuses on single-model chatbot scenarios, where an attacker manipulates one LLM through crafted input. Multi-agent systems amplify this threat through three mechanisms absent from single-model settings: inter-agent message passing creates injection channels invisible to perimeter defenses, shared tool access enables privilege escalation across agent boundaries, and trust propagation allows a compromised agent to influence upstream orchestrators. We construct a threat model enumerating 14 attack vectors across four categories: direct injection via user input (3 vectors), indirect injection via tool outputs (4 vectors), inter-agent injection via message passing (4 vectors), and cascading injection through orchestrator manipulation (3 vectors). Testing all 14 vectors against a 6-agent production-representative system, we find that 67% of agents are vulnerable to at least one scope violation even with system-prompt-level guardrails, and indirect injection via tool outputs succeeds in 43% of attempts. Four architectural defenses reduce overall injection success from 31.2% to 4.2%: message signing with provenance tracking (inter-agent injection down 91%), input/output sanitization at agent boundaries (indirect injection down 78%), privilege-scoped tool access per agent role (privilege escalation eliminated entirely), and anomaly detection on inter-agent communication patterns (84% of cascading attempts caught).
