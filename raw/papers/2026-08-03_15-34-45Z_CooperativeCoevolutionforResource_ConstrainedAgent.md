# Cooperative Coevolution for Resource-Constrained Agentic LLM Post-Training

## Abstract
Tool-using large language model (LLM) agents produce long, multi-turn trajectories, making gradient-based post-training memory-intensive. Evolution strategies (ES) enable memory-efficient full-parameter post-training without backpropagation and can eventually match the performance of gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL). However, resource-constrained settings typically offer only a few GPUs, so the high GPU-hour requirements of ES translate into prohibitively long training times. To address this, we introduce Cooperative Parameter-subspace Evolution Strategy (CoPES), a cooperative coevolutionary method that decomposes the full parameter space into lower-dimensional subspaces and searches over them cooperatively to improve optimization efficiency. We post-train a Qwen3.5-4B tool-using agent for the math task and evaluate it on five benchmarks of varying difficulty. Under the GPU-hour budget of full-parameter GRPO's best validation checkpoint, CoPES recovers 92% of GRPO's validation-accuracy gain, versus 67% for standard ES, while its theoretical GPU memory requirement is less than one-eighth that of full-parameter GRPO. It consistently outperforms standard ES and LoRA-based GRPO on all evaluated pass@k metrics across the five benchmarks. Additional experiments further show the advantage of CoPES on the question-answering task. These results demonstrate an improved trade-off between memory requirements and training time for agentic LLM post-training under resource constraints.
