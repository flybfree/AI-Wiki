# Studying quantization trade-offs for efficient inference deployment in machine translation

## Abstract
Deploying large language models in realistic server environments poses challenges, as the system needs to provide high-quality responses with low latency. Quantization is a common approach to reduce the memory footprint and improve inference efficiency, yet its impact on latency and throughput is rarely evaluated under controlled, orchestration-level workloads. In this work we study the quantization trade-offs of two translation model families, EuroLLM \citep{martins2025eurollm} and Hy-MT2 \citep{zheng2026hy} across five models ranging from 1.7B to 22B for efficient deployment on a single A100 or H100 GPU. We demonstrate that combining a document-chunking strategy with W4A8 or W8A8 quantization improves the latency-throughput Pareto-curve under a wide range of workloads. Furthermore, since standard machine translation (MT) benchmarks rely on isolated sentences and fail to capture long-context dynamics, we introduce a document-level evaluation from WMT24++ to assess how text chunking strategies affect translation quality under quantization. Our results reveal that standard segment-level evaluation can fail to predict the interaction between quantization and long-context document translation. While Hy-MT2 remains robust under quantization, EuroLLM shows strong sensitivity and translation quality collapses rapidly for all considered quantization formats. Overall, our experiments show that the trade-off between inference efficiency and translation quality depends not only on the quantization format, but also on the choice of text chunking strategy.
