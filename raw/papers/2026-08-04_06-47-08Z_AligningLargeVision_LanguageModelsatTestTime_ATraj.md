# Aligning Large Vision-Language Models at Test Time: A Trajectory-Guided Structured Sampling Approach

## Abstract
Post-training reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are commonly used to align large vision-language models (LVLMs) with human intent and the requirements of visual reasoning tasks. However, existing RL-based alignment methods are often resource-intensive and encounter mismatches between training objectives and inference-time distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel test-time alignment approach that leverages trajectory-guided structured sampling for dynamic inference-time refinement, achieving better alignment with visual grounding and ensuring logical consistency. Our approach begins with curating a reasoning memory bank via a trajectory learning algorithm, which decomposes complex question solving into ordered sequences of predefined reasoning patterns. It subsequently accomplishes inference-time alignment by first collecting trajectories from reasoning memory bank to establish a global structural reasoning prior, and then using an iterative Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for localized multi-objective refinement of the reasoning trace. Experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy without incurring prohibitive inference overhead. These results establish trajectory-guided test-time sampling as a scalable and effective alternative to traditional post-training alignment, particularly for complex visual reasoning tasks.
