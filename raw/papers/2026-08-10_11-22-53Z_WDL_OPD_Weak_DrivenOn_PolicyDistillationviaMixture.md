# WDL-OPD: Weak-Driven On-Policy Distillation via Mixture-Constrained Co-Training

## Abstract
On-policy distillation (OPD) aligns a student with a teacher on trajectories sampled from the student itself, reducing the train-test state mismatch of offline distillation. The same feedback loop can nevertheless be unstable: each update changes both the policy and the states on which the next update is computed. We introduce WDL-OPD, a mixture-constrained co-training method with two trainable policies. An anchor policy generates every rollout, an auxiliary policy evaluates the same visited states, and a geometric mixture of their token distributions is matched to a frozen teacher by reverse KL. Both policies receive gradient. We show that freezing the auxiliary recovers an anchor-plus-contrast proxy target closely related to OPD$^2$ and W2S-OPD, whereas joint training creates branch-level degrees of freedom that a static delta cannot express. In recorded Qwen3 experiments at 1.7B and 4B scale, WDL-OPD produces the strongest student checkpoint in each of four scale-domain settings. It raises MATH500 accuracy from 0.630 to 0.685 at 4B and from 0.521 to 0.585 at 1.7B. In code generation, seven single-policy OPD configurations exhibit entropy growth or trajectory degradation, while co-training reaches independently re-evaluated development scores of 0.637 and 0.375. Because several comparisons differ in curriculum or initialization, these results support a stabilization hypothesis rather than a universal causal claim. We provide the exact training algorithm, failure evidence, and the controlled comparison matrix needed to test that hypothesis.
