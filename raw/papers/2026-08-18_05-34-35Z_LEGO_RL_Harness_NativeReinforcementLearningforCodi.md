# LEGO-RL: Harness-Native Reinforcement Learning for Coding Agents

## Abstract
Reinforcement learning for coding agents increasingly relies on long-running agent harnesses to manage tool integration, repository contexts, and execution feedback. However, the native execution environments of these harnesses are inherently misaligned with policy-gradient training: environmental crashes and reward hacking corrupt outcome signals, while train-inference discrepancies decouple rollout behavior from policy updates. To address this, we present LEGO-RL, a framework that bridges native coding-agent harnesses with scalable policy-gradient optimization without modifying their internal control flow. LEGO-RL is built upon three pillars: (1) faithful optimization via in-process LLM proxying that captures raw generation streams for token-level alignment and robust trainer-side log-probability recomputation, even under harness-side compaction or re-serialization; (2) reliable execution via scalable sandbox orchestration featuring image caching and stage-wise defenses to mitigate reward hacking; and (3) observable training through an integrated plugin that automates validation and monitoring, paired with a Live UI for granular trajectory diagnostics. We evaluate LEGO-RL by training the sparse MoE model Qwen3.5-35B-A3B with GSPO across three native coding-agent harnesses. LEGO-RL improves Qwen3.5-35B-A3B across OpenHands SDK (64.0% to 70.4%), Claude Code (62.4% to 68.2%), and OpenCode (57.2% to 66.6%) on SWE-bench Verified, while maintaining a rollout-training probability correlation above 0.99.
