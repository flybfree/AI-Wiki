# Algebraic Decomposition Theory for Transformer Length Generalization

## Abstract
Transformer-based language models are known to sometimes generalize to sequences longer than seen during training, but we lack a precise characterization of which tasks admit length generalization. It is not even known which regular languages transformers length-generalize on -- and this is a foundational class of languages. Our contributions are to establish the first complete characterization of which regular languages transformers length-generalize on and provide a decision algorithm running in polynomial time in the size of the language's syntactic monoid. These results rely on an effective characterization of the regular languages in C-RASP, a recently-established formalism that expresses which languages transformers length-generalize on. This characterization is challenging because classical tools like Krohn-Rhodes decomposition theory for finite semigroups are insufficient for C-RASP. Firstly, the basic building blocks of Krohn-Rhodes theory -- flip-flop and simple groups -- are not expressible in C-RASP. Secondly, the basic building block of C-RASP (unbounded counting) is not expressible by the finite semigroups of Krohn-Rhodes theory. Thus, length generalization on regular languages is controlled by an algebraic property that is invisible to classical finite decomposition theory. We generalize classical decomposition theory from finite semigroups to the infinite additive group on the integers, allowing us to characterize C-RASP in terms of iterated wreath products of the integers and derive a provable polynomial-time decision algorithm for regular language membership. Experiments across a broad test suite of regular languages confirm that our theory captures transformers' length-generalization behavior more accurately than existing classifications.
