# MoPET: Parameter-Efficient Mixture-of-Experts for Unified Medical Image Classification

## Abstract
Adapting deep learning models to profound clinical heterogeneity typically relies on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to avoid the severe overfitting associated with full end-to-end network updates. Although PEFT successfully navigates limited data scenarios, it inherently forces the training of a separate, isolated adapter for every specific diagnostic task. Consolidating these isolated adapters into a single generalist network risks negative transfer, as optimization gradients from conflicting visual domains interfere. To address this, we propose MoPET, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) method that uses a learned sparse router to direct each input through a small subset of low-rank PEFT experts injected into a frozen foundation model, sharing capacity across datasets while limiting cross-domain gradient conflict. Through selected evaluations on the MedMNIST benchmark, we first establish that PEFT outperforms full network updates, improving average accuracy from 86.50% to 88.97%. We then show that a single MoPET model consolidates four heterogeneous datasets into one network, improving average accuracy over the best isolated PEFT adapters (93.46% versus 92.83%). Finally, we show that co-training with auxiliary datasets improves accuracy on data-constrained clinical targets, raising average target accuracy over the strongest isolated adapter from 81.58% to 83.58%.
