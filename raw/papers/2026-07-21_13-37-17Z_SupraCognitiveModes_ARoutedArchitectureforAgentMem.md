# Supra Cognitive Modes: A Routed Architecture for Agent Memory

## Abstract
Agent-memory workloads mix direct factual lookup, relation-chain and current-state reasoning, and broad synthesis over long histories. We describe Supra Cognitive Modes (SCM), an architecture that maps explicit or automatically selected per-query modes to retrieval and synthesis payloads over one shared ingest substrate. A frozen semantic classifier and runtime gates dispatch queries among fused lexical and dense lookup, graph or iterative multi-hop handling, and stratified long-form synthesis. The substrate combines multi-granularity embeddings, extracted triples, fact-version metadata, and optional asynchronous enrichments. We characterize the deployed configuration on three benchmarks: Long-term Conversational Memory (LoCoMo; n = 1,986), MemoryAgentBench (MAB; n = 3,671), and LongMemEval (n = 500). The reference run records 84.87% on LoCoMo factoid categories and 68.61% on adversarial abstention, 61.49% on MAB across two repetitions, and 86.00% on LongMemEval. A repository-backed reproduction produces similar aggregate scores and supports task- and mode-conditioned failure analysis. Raw baseline outputs, aligned end-to-end timing for LoCoMo and LongMemEval, and complete token ledgers are unavailable; stored rows also omit some final runtime decisions. The results characterize one implemented routed configuration and its diagnostic failure patterns, while source inspection verifies the per-query control interface and shared-substrate design. Causal routing effects, efficiency gains, and statistical significance remain outside the available evidence.
