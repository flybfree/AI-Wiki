# LongCat Sparse Attention: Taming the Lightning via Streaming-aware Hierarchical Cross-Layer Indexing

## Abstract
DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA) enables efficient long-context modeling through its Lightning Indexer. However, practical deployment remains constrained by the indexer's expensive $O(L^2)$ scoring overhead and the hardware-inefficient, discontinuous memory-access patterns induced by its outputs. To address these system-level bottlenecks, we introduce LongCat Sparse Attention (LSA), a hardware-algorithm co-designed framework comprising three complementary and orthogonal strategies: (1) Streaming-Aware Indexing, which selectively converts scattered KV entries into hardware-aligned contiguous layouts to enable coalesced HBM access; (2) Cross-Layer Indexing, which amortizes indexing overhead by reusing the results produced by a single layer across consecutive layers, supported by cross-layer distillation; and (3) Hierarchical Indexing, which adopts a coarse-to-fine scoring scheme to progressively narrow the candidate set for each query, thereby substantially reducing indexing computation. Extensive scaling experiments, ranging from 69B-A3B to 560B-A27B models, demonstrate that LSA consistently achieves performance on par with full attention across both general-purpose and long-context benchmarks. Moreover, LSA supports native training with context lengths of up to one million tokens and underpins the development of LongCat-2.0 (1.6T-A48B). To facilitate further research, we also introduce and open-source LongCat-Flash-Lite-Sparse (69B-A3B), which integrates LSA into LongCat-Flash-Lite and incorporates an updated long-context training corpus.
