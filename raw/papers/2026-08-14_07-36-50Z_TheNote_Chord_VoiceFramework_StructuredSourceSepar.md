# The Note-Chord-Voice Framework: Structured Source Separation and Causal Inference for EV Charging Data

## Abstract
Real-world EV charging data exhibit three interlocking pathologies: hardware fragmentation (network timeouts and billing resets split sessions), physical violations (independent energy/duration models produce impossible states like 50 kWh in 10 min on a 7 kW charger), and collider bias (clustering on post-treatment outcomes opens backdoor paths for price elasticity). We propose the Note-Chord-Voice framework, a music-inspired, axiom-driven pipeline that separates data cleaning (Repair Chords), structural pattern discovery (Harmonic Chords), descriptive source separation (NMF Voices), and causal inference into distinct, falsifiable stages. Key innovations: (i) falsification gates (A1-A5, G3, G10) that test data suitability before modeling; (ii) Gamma-initialized NMF with input rescaling for convergence stability from STL decomposition; (iii) tag-based coupon grading (A/B/C/D) to isolate quasi-random treatment from night-time confounders and targeted promotions; (iv) separate per-voice OLS to avoid simplex collinearity; (v) Foote novelty curves for structural regime detection. Applied to the Jiangmen dataset (495,707 sessions, 20 stations, from July 2024 to March 2025), all core axioms pass except G3 (no strong 168 h cycle). NMF achieves R^2=0.9921; the physically constrained duration model yields aggregate R^2=0.5409. Two voices are price-sensitive (beta = -11 to -14 min, p<0.001), of which one is stable (Voice 3, beta=-14.16) and one treatment-driven (Voice 1, beta=-11.10); only the stable voice supports causal claims. Counterfactual simulation shows targeting discounts to price-sensitive voices recovers 52.8% of discount expenditures (~0.85M CNY/year); restricting to the single stable price-sensitive voice yields a more conservative estimate.
