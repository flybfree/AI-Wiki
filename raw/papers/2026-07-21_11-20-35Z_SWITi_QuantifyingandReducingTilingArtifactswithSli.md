# SWITi: Quantifying and Reducing Tiling Artifacts with Sliding Window Inner Tiling

## Abstract
SWITi is a test-time method for reducing artifacts in tiled predictions, particularly for neural networks that learn posterior distributions from which solutions are sampled at inference time. Tiled predictions are unavoidable for large image data, and artifacts arise whenever tiles are smaller than a network's receptive field and when tiles are independent posterior samples. SWITi averages overlapping sliding-window predictions, so discrepancies between neighboring samples are spread across shifted tile positions rather than accumulating at fixed seam coordinates. For posterior models, SWITi uses no more tile samples than an MMSE estimate requires and therefore incurs no additional forward passes. Additionally, we introduce two reference-free metrics, the Fraction of Rejected Tests (FRT) and Artifact Severity (ASV), for detecting and quantifying tiling artifacts from a per-tile permutation test that compares the distribution of pixel gradients across tile seams against the surrounding image content. On pre-trained and published image splitting models across three fluorescence microscopy datasets in 2D and 3D, we show that SWITi substantially attenuates stitching seams while also improving reconstruction fidelity and resolution. Since tiling artifacts in posterior predictions can easily be mistaken for biological structures or for boundaries between biological structures, removing or reducing them using SWITi will improve the downstream processing of large image predictions, which is particularly relevant for biomedical data.
