# Revisiting WEASEL 2.0: Reproduction, Sensitivity, and an Adaptive Ensemble-Size Rule

## Abstract
WEASEL 2.0 is a dictionary-based time series classifier that combines dilated sliding windows with a randomised hyperparameter ensemble and a fixed-size dense feature representation. Two of its hyperparameter choices, the maximum ensemble size and the maximum window size, are specified by simple thresholding rules whose chosen thresholds are not empirically justified in the original paper. In this work we reproduce WEASEL 2.0 on 114 UCR datasets, achieving a mean accuracy of 0.865 and median of 0.928, closely matching the published values (Wilcoxon signed-rank, p = 0.655). We then test the sensitivity of four design choices: the downstream classifier, the absence of feature weighting, the maximum window-size rule, and the maximum ensemble-size rule. The first three are robust to perturbation. The fourth is over-provisioned for long-series datasets, motivating an adaptive rule that sets the maximum ensemble size from series length and number of classes. Evaluated on fixed-length datasets, the adaptive rule reduces peak fit memory by a median of 37 MB (mean 395 MB) and fit time by a median of 0.4 s (mean 4 s), with a median accuracy change of 0% (mean -0.11%). Memory and time savings concentrate on long-series datasets where the original rule allocates the largest ensemble size.
