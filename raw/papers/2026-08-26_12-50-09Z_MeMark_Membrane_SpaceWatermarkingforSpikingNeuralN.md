# MeMark: Membrane-Space Watermarking for Spiking Neural Networks

## Abstract
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly distributed as pretrained checkpoints and reused as backbones for new tasks. However, current SNN watermarks are mainly verified against the model output. Thus, a user who replaces the output head can keep most of the original network while removing the evidence used for verification. We present MeMark, a watermark designed for the checkpoint-reuse setting. Instead of storing the watermark in the output head, MeMark embeds a multi-bit identifier in the internal membrane state of selected Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. A secret input drives each selected neuron to the chosen side of its own firing threshold, and the same threshold is later used to recover the secret bit, so the verifier does not need a learned decoder. We evaluate MeMark across recurrent, convolutional, residual, and transformer SNNs. On a 215.4M-parameter SpikeGPT checkpoint, all 20 independent 64-bit keys pass the fixed 51/64 verification rule, while none of the $30\,000$ fresh random keys pass when tested against all 20 protected checkpoints and the clean model. All 20 genuine keys also remain above the threshold after fine-tuning, 90\% pruning, int8 quantization, and output-head replacement. Under our stated threat model, adaptive attacks can weaken the watermark but do not remove the ownership evidence in the settings we test. Additionally, we study false ownership claims, key-aware and key-agnostic removal, partial key disclosure, rollback, and extraction into a student. The results show that MeMark can provide evidence of checkpoint derivatives, while being resistant to the adversary's attacks and complete head replacement.
