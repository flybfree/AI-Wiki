# RealVDeblur: One-Step Diffusion for Generalizable Real-World Video Deblurring

## Abstract
Real-world video deblurring remains challenging due to diverse motion patterns, complex degradations, and the scarcity of realistic training data, yet robust restoration is critical for downstream pipelines such as mobile imaging and 3D reconstruction. This work presents \textbf{RealVDeblur}, an efficient generative framework designed to improve in-the-wild robustness under diverse real capture conditions. First, a large-scale, physically grounded blur synthesis pipeline is constructed from scene-level 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) assets and high-frame-rate videos, providing realistic training data covering both camera-induced and object-motion blur. Second, a video diffusion prior is leveraged for restoration; to better accommodate frame-dependent blur variations, temporal compression in the VAE is disabled and a frame-wise encoding scheme is adopted. For practical deployment on long videos, multi-step diffusion sampling is distilled into an efficient one-step generator, and a training-free Temporal Window Mask stabilizes inference beyond the training horizon with constant memory usage. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate strong perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and temporal consistency on unseen videos, as well as improved robustness in downstream 3D reconstruction under severe motion blur.
