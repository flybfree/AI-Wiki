# SSAKG 2.0: An Open-Source Package for Structural Associative Sequence Memory and Context-Based Retrieval

## Abstract
This article presents SSAKG 2.0, an open-source software package for constructing and operating Structural Sequential Associative Knowledge Graphs (SSAKGs). An SSAKG represents objects as graph vertices and ordered sequences as structural patterns of graph connections. The resulting sparse graph is used as an associative memory in which complete sequences can be reconstructed from a partial, unordered context.   Version 2.0 introduces new algorithms that exploit individual bits of computer memory to efficiently search graph connections. The package is implemented in Python, while performance-critical graph operations are implemented in C and exposed through a Python interface. This hybrid implementation provides a flexible high-level programming environment while reducing the memory and computational overhead associated with large sparse graphs.   The algorithms were evaluated using randomly generated numerical sequences, sequences derived from sentences in the NLTK corpus, and mRNA sequences. The experiments demonstrate the ability of the package to store and reconstruct sequences from partial contexts and provide a basis for evaluating the effects of graph density, sequence length, and memory size on retrieval performance.   SSAKG 2.0 is distributed under the Apache 2.0 open-source license. The package includes documentation and reproducible examples and is publicly available through GitHub and the Python Package Index (PyPI).
