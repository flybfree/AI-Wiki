# A Diffusion-Model Subpopulation Digital Twin for Mobile Health Deployment: A Case Study on the HeartSteps Intervention

## Abstract
Mobile-health interventions increasingly use online learning and decision making algorithms to personalize when to nudge users toward healthier behavior, but a poorly designed algorithm can burden and disengage participants. New algorithm design decisions should therefore be vetted against realistic simulated users before each real-life deployment. We propose a method to develop ``JITAI-Twins'': digital twins of a target subpopulation for comparing candidate online algorithms before a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) deployment. The method builds on a conditional time-series diffusion model that is temporally consistent (future actions do not affect the generated past), and it supports repeated updating from three sources of information, in three steps: pre-training on a large observational dataset, fine-tuning on small prior intervention deployments in related populations, and inference-time calibration to the next target population from domain-scientist expertise. We validate the twin at each pre-deployment stage of the long-running HeartSteps series (v2 through v4) of physical-activity suggestion intervention deployments, treating each successive deployment as an upcoming study. The proposed method reproduces the target subpopulation's temporal and between-participant structure better than simpler simulators. These results suggest that our twin can be used to simulate a target deployment before it runs, the prerequisite for testing and informing online algorithm design decisions.
