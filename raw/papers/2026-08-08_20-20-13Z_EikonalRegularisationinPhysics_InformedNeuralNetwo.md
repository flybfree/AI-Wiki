# Eikonal Regularisation in Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Three-Dimensional Level-Set Advection: Transferability of Two-Dimensional Design Principles

## Abstract
Physics-informed neural networks applied to the level-set formulation of interface advection commonly augment the residual and initial-condition losses with an eikonal regulariser, penalising the deviation of $\|\nablaφ\|$ from unity. A previous two-dimensional study identified this weight as the dominant hyperparameter and found its optimum shifts by four orders of magnitude between rigid-body and deforming flows, but left open whether these principles transfer to three dimensions and whether single-seed results survive run-to-run variability. We answer both by repeating the weight selection across four 3D benchmarks (translating sphere, rotating sphere, slotted sphere, reversed vortex), sweeping six weights with three seeds at full training budget under a pre-registered selection rule. The ordering transfers: the selected weight tracks how far the exact solution departs from the signed-distance property, spanning four decades from $10^{-1}$ where it holds exactly to $10^{-5}$ where the interface is stretched. Values transfer only benchmark by benchmark; two of four carry over unchanged and two do not, so inheritance must be verified. The multi-seed protocol reveals that at small weights the seed-to-seed standard deviation equals the error itself, and the regulariser reduces it by more than an order of magnitude, buying reproducibility as well as accuracy. We benchmark against a fifth-order WENO solver on identical grids and error measures; the classical scheme is more accurate on all four problems, by two orders of magnitude on smooth rigid advection, with a margin that narrows with geometric difficulty and is smaller in volume conservation than in the field norm. Finally, we show that the relative $L_2$ error cannot certify the preservation of thin features, and report a feature-restricted measure that can.
