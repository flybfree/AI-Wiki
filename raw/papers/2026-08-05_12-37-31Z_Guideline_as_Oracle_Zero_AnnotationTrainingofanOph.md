# Guideline-as-Oracle: Zero-Annotation Training of an Ophthalmic Telephone Triage Agent

## Abstract
Scaling supervision for multi-turn medical agents is difficult because expert dialogue annotation is costly and clinical conversations are privacy-restricted. We introduce Guideline-as-Oracle (GAO), which compiles American Academy of Ophthalmology guidance into a 70-row operational rule table and uses it as the sole source of instance-level supervision for 3,000 training dialogues, reserving human labeling for evaluation. Because converting rules into dialogues is itself a design problem, we catalog eight construction strategies, including cited-row tier assignment, one-fact boundary pairs, metadata-only repair, and label repair, and characterize the evidential status of each: labeling mechanism, null, confounded, or evaluated only as a package. Fine-tuning a 9B backbone on this corpus yields GAO-Triage, improving agreement with a 201-case operational reference from 61.7% to 74.1% (exact McNemar p=0.0046) and emergent-case recall from 9.5% to 69.0%; the gains persist across a second seed and patient simulator. None of the seven general-purpose systems we test dominates GAO-Triage on both metrics, and GAO-Triage requires no frontier model at inference time. Permuting label-dialogue assignments collapses the model to a constant-routine predictor, indicating that the signal lies in guideline-derived assignment rather than dialogue surface form. Label repair coincides with the disappearance of a late-training safety degradation.
