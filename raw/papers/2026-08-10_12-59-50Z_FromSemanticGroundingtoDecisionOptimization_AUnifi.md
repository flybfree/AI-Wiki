# From Semantic Grounding to Decision Optimization: A Unified Framework for Long-Horizon UAV Vision-Language Navigation

## Abstract
UAV vision-language navigation (UAV-VLN) focuses on enabling an aerial agent to follow natural-language instructions in open 3D environments from egocentric visual observations. Current approaches suffer from three coupled issues: weak grounding of instruction-relevant landmarks in visual observations, insufficient exploitation of long-horizon history, and unstable decisions under local traps or repeated exploration. To address these issues, we propose a unified semantic-to-decision framework. First, we present an instruction-grounded semantic enhancement module that injects object-level semantics and relative spatial cues into the current observation state. Subsequently, we develop a relevance-aware dynamic temporal aggregation strategy that reweights the full history buffer while converting a few high-relevance frames into structured landmark prompts for the decoder. Finally, we devise a topology-aware decision method that combines local-optimum cognition with group-relative policy optimization under progress, goal, semantic, and path-compliance rewards. Experiments on the widely used AerialVLN and OpenFly benchmarks clearly demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
