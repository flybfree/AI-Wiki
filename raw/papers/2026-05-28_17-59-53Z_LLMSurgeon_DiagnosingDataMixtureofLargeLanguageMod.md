# LLMSurgeon: Diagnosing Data Mixture of Large Language Models

## Abstract
The pretraining data mixture of Large Language Models (LLMs) constitutes their "digital DNA", shaping model behaviors, capabilities, and failure modes. Yet this composition is rarely disclosed, making post-hoc auditing of data combination or provenance difficult. In this work, we formalize $\textbf{Data Mixture Surgery (DMS)}$: given only generated text from a target LLM, estimate the domain-level distribution of its pretraining corpus under a predefined taxonomy. We propose $\textbf{LLMSurgeon}$, a strong framework that casts DMS as an inverse problem under the label-shift assumption. Rather than directly aggregating classifier outputs, LLMSurgeon estimates a calibrated $\textit{soft}$ confusion matrix and solves a constrained inverse problem to correct systematic domain confusion and recover the latent mixture prior. To evaluate, we introduce $\textbf{LLMScan}$, a recipe-verifiable evaluation suite built from open-source LLMs with transparent pretraining mixtures. Across LLMScan, LLMSurgeon recovers domain mixtures with high fidelity under fixed protocols. Our work presents a practical, post-hoc approach for auditing the digital DNA of foundation models without access to their training data.
