# GeoPhysAdapter: Scale-Matched Geophysical Adaptation for Cross-Domain Landslide Mapping with Vision Foundation Models

## Abstract
Newly triggered landslides rarely carry immediate annotations, so cross-domain transferability determines the value of landslide mapping for emergency response and regional risk assessment. Vision foundation models have strengthened representational transfer, yet on unseen regions, events, and data sources they still generate high-confidence false alarms. Terrain, material, and rainfall triggering can constrain such errors, but their supports are local, regional, and event-scale, so that resampling onto a 10~m grid misaligns them with the segmentation decision unit and compounds the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP). We propose GeoPhysAdapter, which anchors on a frozen vision foundation model, restricts terrain, material, and triggering to dense spatial guidance, regional modulation, and event-timing forcing, and applies bounded adaptation at two decision units, the pixel and the candidate landslide body, reverting exactly to the visual prediction where support is insufficient. On an event-isolated PILD dataset of four public sources, 55 global landslide events, and 7,890 test samples, 70.3% of cross-domain false-positive mass lies in near-pure spurious bodies of median equivalent diameter 207m, matching coarse-prior support rather than the pixel. Pixel-level adaptation removes a net 507,817 erroneous pixels and reduces error by 7.76%, whereas raising the decision unit to the candidate body, under identical samples, anchor, and baseline, increases error reduction to 23.99%, approximately 3.1 times the pixel-level effect, improves IoU by 0.031 (14.2% relative), and corrects 9.92 pixels per pixel harmed. The data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/Liu-Zhihang/geophysadapter.
