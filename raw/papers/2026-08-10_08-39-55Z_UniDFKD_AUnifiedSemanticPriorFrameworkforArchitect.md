# UniDFKD: A Unified Semantic Prior Framework for Architecture-Agnostic Data-Free Knowledge Distillation

## Abstract
Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a pretrained teacher model to a compact student model by synthesizing semantically informative data, eliminating the need for access to the original training dataset. Existing DFKD methods rely heavily on architecture-specific statistical priors (e.g., Batch Normalization statistics) to guide data synthesis, however, such architecture-dependent priors are often absent in modern architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViTs), resulting in degraded semantic quality of the synthesized data and consequently catastrophic performance degradation. In this paper, we propose \emph{UniDFKD}, a unified data-free knowledge distillation framework that replaces architecture-specific statistics with explicit, architecture-agnostic semantic priors. \emph{UniDFKD} governs the entire synthesis-distillation pipeline along three dimensions: (1) Categorical Semantic Conditioning (CSC) defines \emph{what} to synthesize by persistently modulating the generator with language-derived embeddings to capture semantic diversity; (2) Spatial Semantic Anchoring (SSA) dictates \emph{where} evidence belongs by anchoring the teacher's spatial attributions to a Gaussian prior; and (3) Spatial Semantic Distillation (SSD) controls \emph{how} knowledge is transferred by explicitly aligning teacher-student spatial evidence alongside predictions. Extensive experiments across CNNs and ViTs demonstrate that UniDFKD establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by an average absolute margin of over 20\% in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings.
