# Foundation Models for Face Presentation Attack Detection: A Unified Linear-Probing Benchmark

## Abstract
Face presentation attack detection (PAD) remains challenging under cross-dataset evaluation, where domain shift degrades models trained on a single dataset. The scarcity of large-scale labeled data motivates adapting pretrained vision models rather than training task-specific architectures from scratch, raising a fundamental question: do general-purpose vision foundation models encode PAD-relevant information accessible with minimal task-specific training? To investigate, we systematically evaluate 24 frozen encoders, including self-supervised vision transformers, vision-language encoders, and supervised CNNs, using a unified linear-probing protocol on the MCIO benchmark (MSU-MFSD, CASIA-FASD, Replay-Attack, OULU-NPU). The backbone remains fixed, and only a lightweight linear head is trained to isolate the PAD information already present in the pretrained representation. %We report intra- and cross-dataset performance, along with accuracy-compute trade-offs, relative to two specialist PAD baselines. Results show that frozen foundation-model representations can support strong intra-dataset PAD performance with only a linear classifier, but this performance does not reliably transfer across datasets. Model scale is beneficial within several families, although the effect is not monotonic and is strongly mediated by architecture and pretraining. InternViT-6B achieves the lowest mean intra-dataset error, whereas CLIP ViT-B/32 offers the most favorable cross-dataset transfer-compute trade-off among the evaluated probes. These findings suggest that while pretrained representations contain PAD-relevant information, explicit adaptation remains necessary to address domain shift.
