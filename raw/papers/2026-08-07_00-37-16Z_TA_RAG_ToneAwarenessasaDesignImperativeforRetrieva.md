# TA-RAG: Tone Awareness as a Design Imperative for Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a robust architecture for grounding large language models (LLMs) in trusted knowledge. However, standard RAG systems exhibit a structural limitation: retrieved documents carry their own communication styles-professional jargon, formal tone, or academic writings-that shape the behavior of a RAG system before any tone instructions are processed, often causing the system to ignore user requests for a specific tone. We term this phenomenon contextual decoupling, in which a system optimises for factual accuracy while remaining decoupled from the social or operational context of the recipient. Building on prior research in public health peer-support communities, we identify three communicative misalignment-linguistic, cognitive, and relational-that can persist even when retrieval is relevant and the generated response is factually accurate. We conceptualise these as failures of communicative transformation, which remain largely invisible to accuracy-centred RAG evaluation metrics. To address this gap, we propose Tone-Aware RAG (TA-RAG), a conceptual architectural framework that positions communicative alignment alongside factual accuracy as a core design objective. TA-RAG operationalises four constraints-stigma-free language, readability alignment, recipient-sensitive adaptation, and empathetic framing-across the retrieval, context construction, generation, and constraint validation phases in the proposed RAG pipeline. We further highlight an evaluation agenda for jointly assessing factual fidelity and communicative alignment, and identify open challenges. We argue that tone awareness should be treated not as an optional refinement, but as a present design imperative for RAG systems operating in socially sensitive and high-stakes contexts.
