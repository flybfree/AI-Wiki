# $Z^2$-ACT: End-to-End Verifiable Agentic Intent Control for Open 6G RAN

## Abstract
With the progression in open and disaggregated 6G radio access networks, it is expected that the system will be able to host multi-vendors. In order to host multi-vendors, it is essential that AI-assisted control loops remain safe, verifiable, and auditable under concurrent operator intents and untrusted model inputs. The existing studies address the agentic coordination, formal intent constraints, zero-trust prompt verification and cryptographic accountability in isolation, which leaves pre-realization safety, continuous semantic verification and cross-domain audit incomplete when used individually. In this regard, we propose zero-knowledge auditable control and zero-trust verifiable agentic intent architecture ($Z^2$-ACT), which integrates the aforementioned four primitives across the non-real-time and near-real-time RICs. We encode the typed Intent Contracts as operator goals while the large language model inputs are only admitted after a practical adversarial intent check. The skill sequences in the proposed study are released only when a self-management gate is satisfied while every successful commit is recorded as a binding commitment with a zero-knowledge proof. Our experimental evaluation on public ColO-RAN measurements compares the full architecture against targeted ablations and a conventional reinforcement-learning baseline. A live large language model is used in the non-real-time path to translate operator intents into Intent Contracts; we report translation accuracy, the rate of invalid or hallucinated contracts, non-real-time latency, and behavior under adversarial or misleading intents. Near-real-time control remains trace-driven on the public KPM sequences. Results indicate improved actuation filtering and attack resilience at modest latency and signaling cost inside the near-real-time envelope.
