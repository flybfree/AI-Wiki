# SkillAlign: Aligning Skill Interfaces for LLM-based Agents

## Abstract
Language-model agents increasingly rely on skills: reusable procedural knowledge for reasoning, tool use, and interaction. Existing work studies how skills are acquired, retrieved, compressed, or composed, but often assumes that once a skill is selected, its interface to the agent is fixed. We argue that this overlooks a key source of skill utility: the same skill can help, distract, or mislead depending on how it is exposed. We propose SkillAlign, a provider-agnostic framework that represents candidate skills as multi-view procedural cards and renders them through alternative exposure interfaces, including full instructions, hints, compressed summaries, workflows, or no exposure. This enables counterfactual evaluation where the task, agent, and candidate skills are fixed while only the exposure interface varies. Across ALFWorld and SkillsBench, we show that exposure form substantially affects task success and rendered context cost, and that compact top-k exposure can outperform full-library injection. We further conduct a replay-based policy-learning analysis on ALFWorld, showing that adaptive exposure contains learnable signal but remains far from oracle selection. Our results suggest that skill-augmented agents should optimize not only which skills to use, but also how those skills are presented.
