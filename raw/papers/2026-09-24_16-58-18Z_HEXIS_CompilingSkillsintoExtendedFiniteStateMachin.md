# HEXIS: Compiling Skills into Extended Finite State Machines

## Abstract
Agent skills provide reusable knowledge and instructions, yet agents must repeatedly infer how to apply them and which operation should follow. This couples task reasoning with control decisions, allowing prescribed steps to be omitted or applied incorrectly. We introduce HEXIS, which compiles agent skills into extended finite state machines that separate knowledge from control flow. Skill knowledge is incorporated into local instructions that guide reasoning and generation within states. The machine records execution progress and intermediate results, while explicit transition conditions determine subsequent operations. Our incremental compiler first maps skill clauses and tool interfaces to state operations, local instructions, data bindings, and transitions. It then aligns development traces with existing states to identify missing operations and dependencies. These are incorporated by adding or reusing states and refining their connections. Updates are accepted only after static checks and replay of the current and all previously accepted traces. Across four benchmarks and four executors, HEXIS improves success over Skill + ReAct by 16.1 percentage points on average. Qwen3.8-27B reduces execution tokens by 38.4-88.9% across benchmarks.
