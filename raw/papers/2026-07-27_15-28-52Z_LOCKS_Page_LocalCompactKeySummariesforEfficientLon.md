# LOCKS: Page-Local Compact Key Summaries for Efficient Long-Context Decoding

## Abstract
Serving large language models at long context is bottlenecked by the key-value (KV) cache, which is read in full at every decode step. Attention keys are locally low-rank though globally high-rank: shared low-rank bases discard page-specific directions that a page's own compact basis retains. LOCKS gives every page its own spectral summary (resident, about a tenth the cache's size), reconstructs within-page logits, estimates each page's attention mass by log-sum-exp, and attends only the top pages; selection itself reads no candidate keys or values. Selecting on this summary alone stays within about a point of the full cache on long-document QA (LongBench-v1), tracks the read-every-key oracle on retrieval-dense RULER down to the smallest budgets, and shows its largest margins on long-form reasoning (AIME26, MATH-500), where baseline selectors collapse. At its shipped $2048$-token budget LOCKS matches FullKV aggregate quality at $100$K$+$ context while attending about $2\%$ of the tokens, and halves per-token decode latency ($2.0\times$ at $1$M tokens) against dense attention. LOCKS ships as a drop-in plugin for unmodified vLLM, with batched decode running in full CUDA graphs.
