# An MLIR-Based Compilation Method for Large Language Models

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the dominant workload on modern AI accelerators, yet deploying them on specialized hardware still faces two core challenges: how to import a trained model into a compiler-friendly intermediate representation, and how to efficiently schedule the autoregressive inference loop under limited on-chip memory. This paper presents an MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) based compilation method for large language models, illustrated using two dialects of operators, TopOp and TpuOp. TopOp serves as a high-level graph dialect that is independent of both the source framework and the target chip, and is responsible for expressing model semantics; TpuOp serves as the target hardware dialect, carrying chip-related decisions such as quantization, layer groups, and memory layout. A model is first represented as TopOp, then lowered layer by layer to TpuOp, and finally a deployable binary is generated. In addition, each Transformer layer is split into three stages for static compilation: prefill, prefill_kv (prefill with historical key-value cache), and decode, so as to accommodate the different computational characteristics of prompt-parallel processing and per-token generation. The method has been implemented in the TPU-MLIR compiler{https://github.com/sophgo/tpu-mlir} and the LLM-TPU deployment project\footnote{https://github.com/sophgo/LLM-TPU}, supporting a variety of generative models including the Qwen, Llama, InternVL, and MiniCPM-V series, as well as multiple quantization and deployment forms such as GPTQ, AWQ, and AutoRound.
