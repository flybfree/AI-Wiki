# Scaling Adaptive Prompt Injection Attacks with Agent Swarms

## Abstract
Prompt injections have emerged as one of the top security risks faced by AI agents today. Early work in prompt injection attacks looked at simple tool-call agents and static attack payloads, and were saturated since mid-2025. As of Fall 2026, human red-teaming may be nearing saturation, especially on the Gemini family of models. In this work, we argue that despite this apparent plateau, prompt injection attacks are still possible and continued effort into prompt injection defense is needed.   We design a new synthetic evaluation dataset which uses random non-malicious actions as adversarial goals. Such dataset design helps us to evaluate prompt injection robustness as a model ability to respect instruction hierarchy, and disentangle this ability from model knowledge of security practices. We show that an agentic attacker of increased capabilities can reliably trick model to follow instructions in tool output in our evaluation, even for models previously considered robust on public prompt injection benchmarks such as GraySwan Arena. This shows that current frontier defenses may require proactive, automated red-teaming to remain resilient to increasingly capable adversaries.
