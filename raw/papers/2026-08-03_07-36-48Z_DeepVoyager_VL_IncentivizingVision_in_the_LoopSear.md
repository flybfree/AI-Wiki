# DeepVoyager-VL: Incentivizing Vision-in-the-Loop Search for Long-Horizon Multimodal Agents

## Abstract
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced visual understanding and reasoning, yet their static parametric knowledge limits their ability to address knowledge-intensive and dynamically evolving open-world problems. To move beyond this limitation, multimodal deep search has emerged as a key direction for open-world information access, evolving from single-turn factual retrieval toward long-horizon, multi-turn search guided by visual evidence. However, existing methods typically confine vision to the input or answer stage, overlooking its role in intermediate reasoning, and lack designs tailored to long-horizon interaction. Consequently, visual evidence rarely drives continued retrieval, constraining both interaction depth and reasoning span. To address these limitations, we propose DeepVoyager-VL, a long-horizon multimodal deep-search framework for vision-in-the-loop search. Specifically, we construct a multimodal event graph to drive data synthesis, yielding problems with intermediate visual dependencies and long reasoning chains. We then design an agent framework for active visual acquisition and on-demand image loading. Finally, we fine-tune models on the synthesized data without reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across ten multimodal search benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
