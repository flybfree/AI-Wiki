# Qwen-CUA: Native Computer Use for (almost) Everything

## Abstract
Native computer use offers a general interface for agents to operate almost any software available to people, but requires long-horizon state tracking, large-scale interactive experience, and learning from sparse yet verifiable outcomes. We introduce Qwen-CUA, a native computer-use agent with a 397B-A17B Qwen mixture-of-experts backbone. It observes only screenshots and acts through keyboard and mouse events, without DOM trees, accessibility metadata, or task-specific APIs. Its scaffold maintains up to 20 active screenshots and folds older visual history in fixed-size blocks to retain recent evidence while preserving reusable prompt prefixes. For training, we build a cloud rollout fleet with access to nearly 100,000 vCPUs and tens of thousands of concurrent environments, construct approximately 40,000 verifiable tasks, and collect personalized long-horizon workflows across everyday and professional software. We optimize complete trajectories with verifiable rewards and trajectory slicing, while iterative training runs refresh supervised data and recalibrate reinforcement-learning tasks. Across eight benchmarks, Qwen-CUA outperforms Qwen3.7 and remains competitive with leading proprietary systems, reaching 86.2 on OSWorld-Verified and 18.5/48.4 binary/partial completion on OSWorld 2.0. Scaling the same recipe to a model with over one trillion parameters yields Qwen-CUA-Max, improving these scores to 87.6 and 21.2/53.3. Qwen-CUA also reduces RedTeamCUA attack success from 36.6 to 16.4 relative to Qwen3.7. Efficiency analyses, a browser deployment, and Bash-augmented experiments further characterize practical behavior. These results establish native computer use as a broadly capable agent foundation and highlight scalable verifiable interaction and hybrid tool use as key directions.
