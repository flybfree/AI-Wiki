# Tracing the Unlabeled Storm: Cross-Variable Transfer in a Lagrangian Atmospheric JEPA Framework

## Abstract
Deep atmospheric convection governs South Asian monsoon variability, yet attempting to learn its latent world model directly from zero-inflated, heavy-tailed precipitation yields suboptimal predictive representations. Continuous atmospheric proxies, such as outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), express this convective organization far more coherently. We address this mismatch with \emph{cross-variable proxy learning}: M-JEPA, a multiscale Monsoon Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture, is pretrained on five continuous proxy fields over Lagrangian patches tracking moving convective systems---without rainfall supervision at any point. The resulting frozen representation is transferred to daily precipitation forecasts through a shared decoder trunk featuring parallel probabilistic and deterministic branches. Because rainfall is strictly unobserved during pretraining, downstream skill directly measures the predictive information captured in the latent rollout. A frozen-backbone probing framework with two controls (an identical architecture trained on rainfall alone, and a randomly initialized backbone) attributes the transfer specifically to proxy pretraining: direct rainfall training exhibits $36\%$ higher CRPS error ($7.52$ vs.\ $5.54$\,mm/day). Against the 51-member operational ECMWF ensemble, the transferred model attains a statistically resolved CRPS advantage ($6.81$ vs.\ $6.89$\,mm/day) and higher Brier skill ($+0.05$ vs.\ $-0.04$) using $15.4$M parameters on a single consumer GPU, concentrated at heavy-rain thresholds and fine spatial scales, while the ensemble retains an advantage in neighborhood skill and deterministic references on point metrics. The result provides a competitive monsoon precipitation forecast grounded in intraseasonal dynamics and a diagnostic framework for evaluating transferred atmospheric representations.
