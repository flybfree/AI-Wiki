# CLIFT: Turning Gemini Robotics On-Device into Humanoid Specialists via Non-Invasive Closed-Loop Iterative Fine-Tuning

## Abstract
While robot foundation models are growing increasingly capable, the strongest models are typically trained on proprietary data and remain closed-source, limiting downstream users' ability to adapt them to new tasks, embodiments, and deployment settings. Following the LLM community, an emerging access paradigm for closed-weight robot foundation models is the managed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) API, where users submit training data and receive a tuned policy without access to model weights, gradients, or training internals. While such APIs let downstream users leverage powerful proprietary foundation models, they restrict policy improvement to pure imitation, ruling out reinforcement learning and other closed-loop methods that rely on internal training signals. This limitation is particularly acute for agile, contact-rich humanoid manipulation, where the gap between policy outputs and deployed behavior is large due to novel states, action tracking dynamics, latency, and controller-specific failure modes. We study how effective this managed-API regime is for humanoid adaptation, and how closed-loop improvement can be realized within it to push policies toward task mastery. We conduct one of the first empirical studies of managed-API adaptation on a real humanoid, instantiated on Gemini Robotics On-Device (GROD). We find that direct SFT through the API substantially outperforms a leading open-weight VLA trained on the same demonstrations, yet still falls short of deployment-level mastery on agile, contact-rich tasks. To close this gap, we introduce CLIFT: Closed-Loop Iterative Fine-Tuning, which turns deployment-time reward feedback into API-compatible supervised data and enables closed-loop policy improvement without accessing weights, gradients, likelihoods, or losses-pushing GROD to near-perfect success after two flywheel cycles, all without "opening the model box."
