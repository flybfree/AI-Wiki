# CRAMER: Control via Request-Aware Masking for Editing Recommenders

## Abstract
Sequential recommendation models, while powerful, have limited flexibility in responding to immediate user requests, making it difficult to adapt their recommendations to the user's timely interests. Unfortunately, existing user request adaptation methods often incur high computational overhead due to either 1) retraining the entire backbone network or 2) leveraging the inference ability of large language models (a.k.a. prompt engineering), limiting their applicability in large-scale recommendation services. This paper presents Control via Request-Aware Masking for Editing Recommenders (CRAMER), a framework that takes users' natural-language requests to immediately change sequential recommendation models' behavior. Specifically, inspired by the model control theory, CRAMER treats user requests as control signals to modulate frozen backbone parameters through masking, achieving instant adaptation to diverse requests while avoiding costly retraining. Experiments on multiple large-scale benchmark datasets show that CRAMER outperforms four state-of-the-art request-aware baselines across multiple recommendation metrics while achieving minimal overhead. Moreover, the proposed framework exhibits enhanced controllability and cross-domain adaptability, establishing a new paradigm for request-aware sequential recommendation.
