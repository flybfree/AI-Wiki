# POI Recommendation with LLM-Augmented Multi-Graph Learning and Contrastive Alignment

## Abstract
Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation models based on graph neural networks achieve strong performance by propagating collaborative signals over user-item interactions, yet they struggle with the cold-start problem, where items with few or no interactions are not represented. In this paper, we propose LLM-augmented Multi-Graph Contrastive Learning (LLM-MGCL), a multi-graph neural network that uses semantic and spatial information about items to extend the LightGCN backbone with two auxiliary item-item graphs: a semantic graph constructed from sentence embeddings of LLM-generated photo summaries and keywords, and a geographic graph derived from Haversine distances between business locations. Item embeddings are propagated over all three graphs in parallel, fused additively, and aligned across views through a bidirectional InfoNCE contrastive objective that connects behavioral, semantic, and spatial representations of the same items. Experiments on the Yelp Multimodal Recommendation Dataset show that LLM-MGCL outperforms classical collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and interaction-only graph neural network baselines. It improves Recall@20 by 52.0% and NDCG@20 by 64.8% over LightGCN while performing on par with the strongest contrastive baseline, Self-supervised Graph Learning (SGL), which is also affected by the cold-start problem. An ablation study reveals that the cross-view contrastive alignment (CA) is the primary driver of these gains, with the best performance achieved when all three graphs are combined. Our results suggest that externally grounded, LLM-derived item knowledge can effectively compensate for missing collaborative signal and mitigate the item cold-start problem in POI recommendation.
