# TRACE: Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Conversational Engine

## Abstract
Public service chatbots are expected to deliver recommendations from an underlying public service directory, while also making sure that the recommendations respect explicit user constraints. In practice, public service directories are noisy and inconsistent, and general-purpose large language model (LLM) or AI-based chatbots frequently generate unreliable recommendations, citing unverified sources from the web. We investigate the impact of retrieval quality on constraint-aware recommendation in public service conversational systems built over noisy and heterogeneous service directories. We propose TRACE (Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Conversational Engine), a retrieval-based, constraint-aware framework that parses input user queries into structural and semantic constraints for downstream retrieval, with the help of a dual data representation schema. Using a curated statewide pantry directory and a synthetic query benchmark, we evaluate multiple knowledge-representation variants with and without knowledge graphs (KGs). We experiment with several open-source LLMs and a proprietary model, showing that strengthening retrieval substantially improves user constraint satisfaction while reducing hallucinated recommendations. Performance differences across LLMs narrowed in our experiments as retrieval quality improved, making results less sensitive to model size. These findings suggest that the quality of retrieval is key for robust public service conversational systems.
