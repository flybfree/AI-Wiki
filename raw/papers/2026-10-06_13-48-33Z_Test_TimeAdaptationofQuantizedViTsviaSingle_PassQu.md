# Test-Time Adaptation of Quantized ViTs via Single-Pass Quantizer-Aligned Recalibration

## Abstract
Post-training quantization is a standard route to fitting vision transformers (ViTs) into edge compute and memory budgets, yet quantized models become especially brittle under distribution shift. Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses such shifts without labels, but most existing approaches are poorly aligned with the constraints of quantized inference. Prevailing TTA methods recover accuracy through backpropagation, while backprop-free methods often still incur overhead from extra forward passes or parameter updates, and lightweight feature- or logit-level methods recover only part of the loss. Across these approaches, a quantization-specific failure mode that amplifies the drop is not directly targeted: under shift, activations occupy frozen quantizers' calibrated ranges differently, distorting their code distribution. We propose Quantizer-Aligned Recalibration (QuAR), a single-pass TTA method tailored to quantized ViTs that neither backpropagates nor updates any model parameters. QuAR recalibrates activations at the input to a frozen quantizer, mapping the test stream's running per-channel statistics back toward the source calibration. On ImageNet-C with ViT-B, QuAR achieves the highest mean accuracy among state-of-the-art backprop-free TTA methods at 3-, 4-, 6- and 8-bit weight/activation precision, outperforming the strongest baseline by 2.28 points at 8 bits and 4.00 at 3 bits, with 46% lower latency and a memory overhead of only 0.17 MB (0.01% of peak inference memory). Analysis and diagnostics trace the gain to a reduced per-channel mismatch at these quantizers, which restores the code distribution the baselines leave unchanged or distort further. A single fixed configuration remains ahead across continual streams, non-i.i.d. label shift, seven out-of-distribution suites, and three other backbones.
