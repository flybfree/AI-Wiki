# Cross-Layer Interaction under Weight-Space Ablation: A Closed-Form Attention Jacobian Bound and a Test on a Real Pretrained Model

## Abstract
A companion paper studies when activation patching and weight-space ablation agree, inside an idealized model where a conditional computation is carried additively through a residual stream. For the one composition in that model where two carriers are architecturally dependent, an attention head and its own layer's normalization-MLP composition, it derives an exact first-order interaction formula, zero when only the MLP is ablated and second-order bounded when the head is also ablated. That result is confined to a single residual block and checked only on small transformers on a synthetic task.   This paper extends the result past both limits. First, the interaction from ablating carriers spanning several layers decomposes exactly into same-block terms, one per touched layer, plus a cross-layer remainder on which the decomposition makes no claim of smallness. Second, we isolate that remainder exactly, for two layers, as a double integral of a mixed second derivative, and name the missing ingredient needed to bound it: a Jacobian bound for the attention sub-block. We derive this bound in closed form and verify it, without a single violation, against Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct's real weights, though we do not yet chain it across layers. We also give, in closed form, the curvature constant the companion paper's bound leaves unexhibited.   Third, on that same model, we search for and find an emergent circuit for indirect object identification, never designed into it, using the original activation-patching method for this task, and test collapse, dissociation, and interaction on it. The result is mixed: a shared carrier emerges across all five tested instances, collapse and dissociation hold on most but not all, and a nonzero interaction is measurable on three of five, at layer pairs outside the same-block case the companion theorem covers.
