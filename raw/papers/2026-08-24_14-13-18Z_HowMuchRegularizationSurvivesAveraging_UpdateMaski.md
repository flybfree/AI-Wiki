# How Much Regularization Survives Averaging? Update Masking in Federated Learning

## Abstract
Federated learning on non-IID data seeks flat minima to generalize across clients, and existing methods borrow sharpness-aware minimization from centralized training. There is a second way to reach flat minima, in which the regularization comes for free from noise added to the parameter updates, and it has never been carried over to the federated setting. We show the reason. Masking charges the optimizer for moving in sharp directions. We prove that when each client draws its own mask, federated averaging weakens that charge by exactly the cohort size, and that giving every client the same mask brings it back by a factor equal to the inverse gradient diversity of the cohort. In our experiment setting on CIFAR-10, that factor is 1.19 out of a possible 10. Turning off minibatch sampling raises it to 8.96, while changing data heterogeneity a hundredfold leaves it between 1.17 and 1.50. The configurations keeping the regularization train far too poorly to use.
