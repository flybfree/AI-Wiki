# LITEWAY: LIghtweight HAR via Temporal Efficient highWAY

## Abstract
Wearable human activity recognition (HAR) remains challenging due to the computational and energy constraints of deep learning models on resource-limited devices. Existing lightweight approaches often rely on recurrent architectures (e.g., GRU and LSTM), limiting parallelism and increasing inference latency. We propose LITEWAY, a modality-agnostic, fully convolutional framework for multichannel sensor time series that replaces recurrent temporal modeling with structured convolutional decomposition. LITEWAY combines lightweight convolutional blocks, strided temporal processing, and convolution-attention pooling to efficiently capture temporal dependencies while reducing computational complexity. We evaluate LITEWAY on 16 HAR datasets against TinyHAR, TinierHAR, and MLP-HAR. LITEWAY achieves competitive macro F1 while reducing model size by 4.06x-9.52x (Light) and 3.87x-9.07x (Full) compared with TinyHAR and TinierHAR. Deployment experiments further show energy reductions of 2.29x-3.14x (Light) and 1.46x-2.01x (Full) compared with TinierHAR and MLP-HAR, highlighting efficient fully convolutional temporal modeling for wearable HAR.
