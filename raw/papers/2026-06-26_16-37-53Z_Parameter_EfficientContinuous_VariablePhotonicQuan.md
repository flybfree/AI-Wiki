# Parameter-Efficient Continuous-Variable Photonic Quantum Neural Networks for Edge Quantum AI: Demonstration in Oral Cancer Detection

## Abstract
Early detection of oral cancer markedly improves clinical outcomes, yet specialized diagnostic tools remain scarce in low-resource settings. Smartphone-based screening is a scalable alternative but needs lightweight models that run within edge-hardware constraints. Hybrid classical-quantum architectures are emerging candidates for parameter-efficient learning, yet most rely on qubit hardware that needs cryogenic operation, unsuitable for edge deployment. Continuous-variable (CV) photonic quantum computing, which operates at room temperature, offers a complementary route. We investigate a hybrid classical-CV quantum classifier for oral cancer detection from smartphone images. The pipeline combines a MobileNetV1 feature extractor, principal component analysis to 16 dimensions, and a parameterized CV-QNN of displacement, interferometric, and Kerr gates on a photonic backend. We propose a simplified $Φ\circ D \circ U_1$ CV-QNN architecture that cuts trainable parameters 40-45% relative to the standard CV-QNN layer of Killoran et al. (2019a), and identify dimensionality-reduction and encoding-restriction strategies that mitigate barren plateaus, raising loss-gradient variance by roughly 58 orders of magnitude. Whether the simplified layer beats the full layer is width-dependent: the full layer holds a small but significant edge at two qumodes, whereas the simplified layer is significantly better at four qumodes using 44% fewer parameters. The strongest model, a four-qumode simplified CV-QNN with only 18 parameters, attains the highest validation AUC of all models, exceeds a 55-parameter classical baseline using 67% fewer parameters, and reaches 100% calibrated test accuracy across all seeds. These results support CV photonic quantum machine learning for parameter-efficient, room-temperature medical image classification and motivate progress toward edge quantum AI.
