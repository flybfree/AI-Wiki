# Multi-output Gaussian process prediction of physical fields under linear equality constraints

## Abstract
We address the simultaneous prediction of multiple high-dimensional physical fields governed by linear equality constraints, a setting that arises in many real-world applications in physics machine learning. Gaussian process (GP) regression is a widely used surrogate modeling approach due to its effectiveness in small-sample regimes and its ability to provide uncertainty quantification. However, applying GP models in this setting raises two major challenges: the high dimensionality of the discretized output fields and the enforcement of the physical constraint in predictions. For the latter, a common strategy consists in deducing one output from the others via the constraint relation. Through a benchmark, we show that this deductive approach is sensitive to the arbitrary choice of which output to deduce, affecting both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification. Consequently, there is a need for an approach that treats all fields symmetrically while strictly respecting the underlying physics. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a robust framework for jointly modeling constrained multi-field data. Our approach first leverages a specific PCA procedure for multi-field data, coined row-wise PCA, which has the interesting property of preserving the constraint in the latent space. Since standard PCA strategies for multi-field data do not preserve such constraints, we investigate theoretically the optimality of the row-wise choice. In a second step, we consider a linearly-constrained multi-output GP approach based on a specific kernel parametrization which is trained on the latent space of row-wise PCA. The proposed framework is validated on a population dynamics problem and on an industrial CFD application, which involves the prediction of Reynolds stress tensor components under the incompressibility constraint.
