# RISE: Roadside Infrastructure Sequence Understanding across 3D Tracking and Structured Vision-Language Reasoning

## Abstract
We present RISE (Roadside Infrastructure Sequence Understanding and Evaluation), a framework spanning metric 3D tracking and structured vision-language reasoning in roadside sequences. For metric tracking, our image-only method combines SAM3 video identities with calibration-guided mask agreement for multi-view identity association, recovering persistent 3D tracks without LiDAR or task-specific 3D training. Its calibration-conditioned geometry allows the procedure to be instantiated at different calibrated multi-camera intersections without layout-specific retraining. On 20 human-reviewed clips from six intersections, the generated tracks achieve 66.9 MOTA within the defined multi-view evaluation scope. For structured vision-language reasoning, a human-reviewed MLLM pipeline mines high-value clips and uses a constrained full-context Oracle to construct bbox-grounded predictive QA without exposing future evidence to evaluated models. The resulting RISE-VQA dataset contains 33,910 QA pairs from 557 clips across 16 intersections and 61 roadside views. Its intersection-held-out RISE-Bench evaluates semantic choices, coordinates, future boxes, and interaction sets with deterministic task-specific metrics. Experiments show consistent benefits from domain adaptation and generally from temporal context, while revealing persistent challenges in spatial grounding, future localization, and interaction reasoning.
