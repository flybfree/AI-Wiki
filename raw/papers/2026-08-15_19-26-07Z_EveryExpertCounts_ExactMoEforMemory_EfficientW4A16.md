# Every Expert Counts: ExactMoE for Memory-Efficient W4A16 Inference

## Abstract
Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) language models reduce arithmetic by activating only a small subset of experts per token, yet deployment still requires storing and moving the full expert bank. We present ExactMoE, an inference design that applies symmetric group-128 four-bit weight quantization only to routed experts, stores those experts in kernel-native MARLIN form in pinned host memory, and executes all selected experts through a configurable GPU-resident slot cache and fused grouped MoE kernels. The router, attention, embeddings, normalization layers, and language-model head remain in BF16. "Exact" refers to complete expert availability and an unchanged top-k routing procedure: no expert is pruned, substituted, or forced to execute on the CPU. It does not imply numerical identity with the BF16 model. On OLMoE-1B-7B-0924-Instruct, evaluated on a single NVIDIA L4, a 16-slot configuration reduces peak reserved GPU memory from 14.168 to 1.836 GiB (87.04%) while retaining 81.85% of BF16 decode throughput. A fully resident 64-slot configuration reaches 31.923 tokens/s versus 21.662 tokens/s for BF16 while reserving 4.061 GiB. Across 12,450 zero-shot multiple-choice questions, ExactMoE obtains 70.3534% normalized accuracy versus 70.8996% for BF16, retaining 99.23% of the baseline accuracy. In a matched 16-token ablation, fused grouped execution is 1.97x as fast as a sequential W4 reference. These results identify a practical memory-transfer-throughput frontier for complete-expert MoE inference.
