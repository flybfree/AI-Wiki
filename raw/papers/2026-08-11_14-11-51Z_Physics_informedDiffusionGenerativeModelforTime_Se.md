# Physics-informed Diffusion Generative Model for Time-Series Data Synthesis in Dynamic Systems

## Abstract
Industrial time-series signals, such as turbine temperature and rotational speed in aero-engines, are essential for monitoring the health and operational status of complex dynamical systems. However, collecting such data is often limited by harsh environments (e.g., high temperature and high pressure) and the high cost of experimental testing. To address this challenge, we introduce PhysDGM, a stepwise physics-embedded diffusion generative model for synthesizing time-series data that are consistent with the underlying physical laws of dynamical systems. PhysDGM embeds physical laws directly into each reverse diffusion step of the generative process, ensuring trajectory-level physical consistency, rather than enforcing constraints only at the final output. A large-scale AI-synthetic dataset (4.4 million samples, 20x scale-up) constructed by PhysDGM demonstrates strong fidelity across 34 datasets spanning turbofan engines, aero-engines, batteries, and chemical processes. After incorporating the synthetic data, the downstream task performance substantially surpassed that using real data alone by 48% for remaining useful life prediction, 15% for health indicator estimation, 22% for state-of-health assessment, and 20% for fault diagnosis. Moreover, it requires 10-20x less training data than existing approaches, substantially reducing the high cost of data collection in dynamical systems. We further demonstrate PhysDGM's potential in identifying early-stage faults in aero-engines by incorporating AI-synthesized data. In summary, PhysDGM provides a solid foundation for generating physically consistent industrial time-series, paving the way for expanding physics-guided AI into diverse data-scarce environments, including both industrial machinery and complex chemical reaction dynamics.
