# Learning from the Test: Self-Referential Differential Testing for Deep RL Agents

## Abstract
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved significant success in complex decision-making problems. As DRL systems are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their quality and reliability is paramount. Current works primarily focus on detecting safety-critical failures, often neglecting policy optimality, which can lead to reduced efficiency, user distrust, and economic losses. This oversight, compounded by the inherent "testing oracle problem" for optimality, leaves a significant gap in comprehensively evaluating DRL systems. To address this gap, we propose Delta (Differential Testing for DRL Agents), a novel and comprehensive framework that automatically identifies both safety-critical and optimality bugs in DRL agents. Delta employs a two-phase approach: (1) Safety Testing, where the Agent Under Test (AUT) is evaluated for catastrophic failures while collecting data from its decision-making policy, and (2) Optimality Testing, where this collected data from the prior phase is used to train a challenger agent via Offline Reinforcement Learning. Differential testing is then performed by comparing the challenger agent against the AUT; instances where the challenger achieves higher cumulative rewards indicate optimality issues in the AUT. We demonstrate Delta's effectiveness across five environments. We investigate the effectiveness of three offline RL algorithms (BC, BCQ, and CQL) in generating challenger agents. Experimental results demonstrate that safety testing datasets are valuable for training competent DRL agents. Challenger agents trained with BCQ proved most effective for identifying optimality issues within the framework of Delta. Across the five environments, Delta uncovered an average of 2,518 optimality issues, outperforming the baseline methods by 50.2%.
