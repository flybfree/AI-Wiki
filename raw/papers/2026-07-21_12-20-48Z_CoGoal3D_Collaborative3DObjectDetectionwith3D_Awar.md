# CoGoal3D: Collaborative 3D Object Detection with 3D-Aware Fusion and Refinement

## Abstract
V2X collaborative object detection features overcoming the limitations of single-vehicle systems by aggregating environmental features from multiple collaborative agents. However, existing mainstream V2X perception methods mainly focus on 2D BEV object detection. When 3D detection task is concerned, inferior results are obtained because they ignore the 3D spatial misalignment caused by differing height and attitude among the collaborators. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative 3D object detection framework called CoGoal3D, which extracts and refines the 3D feature gradually in a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, a multiscale 3D-aware global fusion module is designed to mitigate the 3D spatial misalignment. The resulting proposals are then refined in the second stage with an auxiliary task of 3D point reconstruction. An effective multi-agent collaborative data augmentation strategy is further proposed to enrich the training data while minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments on public real-world datasets demonstrate that our CoGoal3D achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with 3D AP@0.7 improvements of 10.86%, 10.34%, and 10.18% on the DAIR-V2X, V2V4Real, and V2X-Real datasets, respectively.
