# EvoWiki: Incremental State Overwriting and Traceable Question Answering for Cross-Meeting Knowledge Evolution

## Abstract
In long-term collaboration spanning multiple meetings, factual states such as decisions and risks are continually revised, overturned, and replaced. Existing long-context methods typically stack the entire history, while many RAG and structured-memory methods organize knowledge as static or append-only facts and rely on semantic relevance at read time. Without explicit modeling of knowledge lifecycles, these approaches may retain conflicting old and new states simultaneously or discard history, leading to stale retrieval and answers that are difficult to verify. We present EvoWiki, an incremental question-answering architecture for dynamic long-form text. EvoWiki decouples offline incremental construction (BUILD) from online structured reading (READ). BUILD captures the intra-meeting micro-evolution from proposal to decision and uses entity version chains and a fine-grained State-Overwrite Protocol to explicitly distinguish current valid states from superseded history while preserving meeting-level provenance anchors. READ bypasses relevance-based Top-k retrieval and performs deterministic entity addressing, temporal resolution, and cross-entity multi-hop aggregation over the complete Wiki to produce grounded and traceable answers. We further introduce CrossMeet, a high-fidelity bilingual benchmark designed to simulate long-term state evolution, covering factual consistency, temporal reasoning, and cross-meeting multi-hop reasoning. Across six datasets and two reader models, EvoWiki improves macro-average Judge Accuracy over the strongest baselines by 9.72 and 10.00 percentage points, respectively. Human evaluation shows that EvoWiki is more robust and factually faithful under frequent state flips, validating valid-state-oriented reading as a reliable approach to cross-meeting knowledge evolution.
