# Hypergraph-based Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Incremental Refinement

## Abstract
Modern Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (M-RAG) systems are fundamentally limited by the binary connectivity paradigm of traditional simple graphs, which fails to capture the intricate, high-order correlations among heterogeneous entities, such as the N-ary relationships between a visual chart, its scattered textual descriptions, and underlying numerical data. Furthermore, existing refinement strategies often rely on exhaustive, full-page reconstruction to align cross-modal information, leading to prohibitive computational redundancy and the introduction of contextual noise in long-form document processing. In this paper, we propose Hyper-M2RAG, a novel framework that redefines multimodal document retrieval through High-order Hypergraph Representation Learning. We first formalize the document structure as a Multimodal Hypergraph, utilizing hyperedges as unified semantic containers to encapsulate multi-way associations across text, images, and tables, thereby transcending point-to-point modeling. To mitigate semantic fragmentation caused by physical pagination, we introduce an Anchor-driven Incremental Refinement mechanism. Rather than performing a global sweep, our approach identifies boundary-crossing anchor nodes and reconstructs their local hyper-topology using one-hop neighborhood contexts. This targeted refinement effectively bridges cross-page knowledge gaps with minimal computational footprints. Extensive evaluations on multimodal benchmarking datasets demonstrate that Hyper-M2RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both retrieval precision and generation coherence.
