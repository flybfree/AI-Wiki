# Event-triggered Implicit Perturbation for Zeroth-Order Fine-Tuning of Spiking Transformers

## Abstract
Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization estimates gradients using only forward-pass evaluations, making it suitable for fine-tuning non-differentiable, event-driven spiking neural networks (SNNs). However, its deployment on in-memory computing (IMC) accelerators is constrained by the repeated read-modify-write (RMW) operations arising from explicit weight perturbation and the prohibitive hardware footprint of random number generators (RNGs) for statistically independent per-weight perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose an implicit-perturbation ZO (IPZO) architecture in which perturbation sums computed by an event-triggered perturbation generation unit (PGU) are combined with the weighted sums produced by the IMC array, eliminating perturbation-induced RMW operations while preserving weight-stationary execution of IMC. By exploiting spike sparsity, the PGU generates and accumulates perturbation contributions only for spike-activated weight rows, reducing the required row dimension of the RNG array. An address-driven XOR recombination scheme (PGU-XOR) is further introduced to mitigate the spatial correlations caused by direct RNG reuse (PGU-Reuse). The results show that (1) PGU-XOR matches software RNGs in accuracy on Spikingformer/CIFAR-10 (76.41% vs. 76.53%) and perplexity (PPL) on SpikeGPT/WikiText-2 (54.20 vs. 53.23), whereas PGU-Reuse degrades accuracy by 9.56 percentage points and increases PPL by 11.8; (2) implemented in a TSMC 16-nm CMOS technology, PGU-XOR incurs 40.3%-46.0% area and 15.2%-48.9% energy overhead per matrix-vector multiplication relative to PGU-Reuse, yet its faster convergence reduces the total perturbation energy to 0.51x that of PGU-Reuse at iso-accuracy; (3) IPZO reduces the perturbation energy to 0.46x-0.83x that of conventional explicit weight perturbation for a batch size of B=64 and T=4 time steps, with the advantage growing as BT decreases.
