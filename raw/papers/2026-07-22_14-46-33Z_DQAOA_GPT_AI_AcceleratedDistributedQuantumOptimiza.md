# DQAOA-GPT: AI-Accelerated Distributed Quantum Optimization for Combinatorial Problems

## Abstract
While combinatorial optimization problems are central to many scientific and engineering applications, their solution remains challenging due to exponentially large search spaces. Variational quantum algorithms offer a promising route for tackling such problems, yet their practical performance is limited by repeated quantum circuit evaluations and classical parameter updates. In this work, we introduce DQAOA-GPT, a hybrid framework that integrates the distributed quantum approximate optimization algorithm (DQAOA), which decomposes a large optimization problem into smaller sub-problems, with GPT-based quantum circuit generation for solving those sub-problems. Rather than relying on iterative variational optimization, the proposed approach uses a trained generative model to directly generate high-quality quantum circuits for the decomposed sub-problems. As a benchmark, we evaluate DQAOA-GPT against conventional DQAOA on dense HUBO optimization problems with up to 100 decision variables. The results demonstrate that DQAOA-GPT significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining competitive solution quality, with larger acceleration observed for larger sub-problem sizes. Although this work focuses on benchmark-scale validation, the framework provides a promising foundation for larger-scale combinatorial optimization in hybrid HPC-QC environments through increased GPU resources and parallel computing capability.
