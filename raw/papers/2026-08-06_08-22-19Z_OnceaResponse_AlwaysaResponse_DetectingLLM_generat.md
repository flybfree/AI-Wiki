# Once a Response, Always a Response: Detecting LLM-generated Text via Latent Prompt Restoration

## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent and convincing text at scale, creating growing risks for misinformation dissemination, educational misuse, and platform governance. These concerns make robust detection of machine-generated text increasingly necessary. Recent zero-shot detectors mainly exploit probability-based statistical discrepancies, but they do not explicitly account for the training process of LLMs, which leaves a distinct generation mechanism insufficiently modeled and limits detection robustness. To address this issue, we propose EchoPrompt, a training-free detector based on latent prompt restoration. Our key intuition is that machine-generated text is typically produced conditioned on an upstream prompt, and this hidden dependency can be partially reactivated by prepending a unified generic prefix. Specifically, EchoPrompt restores a generic assistant-response context, measures the induced likelihood gain with an instruction-tuned model, calibrates it against the corresponding base model, and aggregates the resulting differences into a score that quantifies latent prompt dependency. Extensive experiments show that EchoPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot detectors while maintaining strong robustness across challenging evaluation settings.
