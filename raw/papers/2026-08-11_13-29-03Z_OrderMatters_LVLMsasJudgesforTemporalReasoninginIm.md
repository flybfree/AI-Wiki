# Order Matters: LVLMs as Judges for Temporal Reasoning in Image Sequences

## Abstract
As generative multimedia evolves from static image synthesis to complex, interleaved visual narratives, a foundational bottleneck has emerged: the judgment crisis. While human perception naturally synthesizes the temporal and logical flow of a story, automated evaluation systems remain largely "blind" to sequential continuity, often failing to distinguish between a coherent narrative and a semantically shuffled or contradictory sequence. This work identifies a critical structural gap in current multimodal evaluation paradigms, arguing that the reliance on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as judges is fundamentally limited by architectural biases. Our analysis reveals a profound performance dichotomy: while models may appear competent in isolated pointwise scoring, they suffer a catastrophic collapse when required to perform pairwise discrimination of temporal order. We demonstrate that this is not merely a data-scarcity issue but a structural one. Through a series of diagnostic probes, we uncover systematic positional asymmetries, specifically primacy and recency effects, where a model's judgment of a story is significantly influenced by the placement of a frame, often more than by its semantic consistency. These biases, potentially rooted in causal masking and rotary embeddings, suggest that current transformer-based judges are inherently ill-equipped for long-form visual reasoning. By exposing these blind spots, we challenge the multimedia community to move beyond snapshot-centric metrics and instead pioneer Temporally-Aware Evaluation paradigms that treat visual sequences as unified logical structures rather than unordered collections of frames.
