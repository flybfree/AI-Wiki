# Refusal Reads Only a Slice of What the Model Knows: Harm-Keyed Routing and Its Exceptions Across Model Families

## Abstract
Alignment applied after pretraining is shallow in a measurable way: a single direction in a model's residual stream can be edited out, and the model stops refusing harmful requests. That fact says how easily refusal can be removed, not what the refusal decision was reading in the first place. We ask what it reads, and we separate that from what the model comprehends. Across four open-weight models spanning three families, moral comprehension is native to pretraining: a low-rank moral subspace crystallizes during pretraining, and alignment rotates it once without rebuilding it. The refusal gate, in contrast, is a fresh post-training construction with only a weak pretraining precursor, written into a narrow control-token channel where the refusal decision is orthogonal to the moral-judgment decision. The central result is causal and comes from one model, OLMo-3. A nested interchange rank sweep patches successively larger slices of the moral subspace between matched requests and reads how much of refusal's response transfers: as the basis widens, moral judgment keeps reading more of it, while refusal levels off at the level of a single harm direction, and about three-quarters of refusal's causal input lies outside the moral subspace altogether. Refusal reads the harm percept, not the moral content that judgment reads on the same patches. The picture is not uniform across families. Llama reads broad moral content; Qwen reads beyond the single harm cue but is unresolved at our sample size; GPT-OSS reads harm, and its refusals can be argued in either direction by its own reasoning trace. Where refusal reads only a low-rank slice and routes around the bulk of what the model knows, a rank-one edit removes it. Whether widening what refusal reads would also deepen the behavior is the open question this raises.
