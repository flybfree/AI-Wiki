# Neural Kolmogorov Equations: Parallelizable Learning of Stochastic Dynamics under General Noise

## Abstract
Neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning noisy or stochastic dynamics directly from data; however, existing approaches largely assume uncoupled and continuous noise, limiting their applicability to realistic stochastic drivers, and often scale poorly in time, requiring expensive autoregressive training. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Kolmogorov Equations (NKEs), a deterministic, infinite-dimensional reformulation of Neural SDEs based on the Kolmogorov Forward equation, transforming the learning problem from modelling individual stochastic trajectories to modelling the evolution of probability densities. NKEs learn general Lévy-type stochastic forcing directly through the operator structure of the KFE, and enable parallel-in-time training via a Lagrangian Galerkin projection and operator splitting. We evaluate NKEs on several stochastic benchmarks, including systems with coupled noise and jump processes, and verify that NKEs provide flexible models that accurately recover deterministic and stochastic dynamics with competitive predictive accuracy and improved training efficiency. Code and pretrained models will be released.
