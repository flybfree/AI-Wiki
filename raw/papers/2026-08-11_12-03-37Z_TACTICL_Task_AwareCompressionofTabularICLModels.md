# TACTICL: Task-Aware Compression of Tabular ICL Models

## Abstract
The strong performance of foundation models for tabular tasks comes at substantial inference costs. Distilling models into task-specific architectures reduces model size and computational demands but also sacrifices in-context adaptability. Here we introduce TACTICL, an automated task-aware compression framework for tabular in-context learning models that jointly prunes transformer layers and replaces them with lightweight adapters trained on downstream tasks, thus blending in-context with in-weight learning. We study TACTICL on 47 benchmark datasets and show that we can substitute up to 85% of layers without substantial performance drop on a given downstream task. We further show that TACTICL maintains robustness to data shifts, leaving its in-context ability intact. Overall, TACTICL provides a robust framework for exploiting the depth-wise redundancy of tabular foundation models by combining task-specific adaptation and structured compression. We provide the code at: https://github.com/Hebog/tfm_compression
