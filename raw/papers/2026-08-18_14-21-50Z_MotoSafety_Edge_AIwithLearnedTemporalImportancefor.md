# MotoSafety: Edge-AI with Learned Temporal Importance for Two-Wheeler Collision Risk Assessment Under Time Pressure

## Abstract
Powered two-wheeler riders face critical safety challenges in low- and middle-income countries, yet limited studies exist on how cognitive stressors such as Time Pressure influence collision risk. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale dataset of over 129,000 labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 simulator rides by 51 participants under No, Low, and High TP, capturing 64 features across vehicle dynamics, control inputs, proximity, and behavioral violations. Building on this dataset, we propose MotoSafety, a novel edge-AI architecture grounded in the Learned Temporal Importance principle. MotoSafety achieves 94.97% accuracy and 99.33% ROC AUC, outperforming ten baselines, including TimesNet and LLM4TS, and achieves 0.039 MSE and 0.094 MAE for forecasting (4.4x lower error than Time-LLM and iTransformer). With only 1.15M parameters and 0.135 ms latency, it is suitable for edge deployment on low-cost CPU hardware. Using ground truth TP as an inductive bias improves accuracy from 94.09% to 94.97%, while predicted TP achieves 94.82%. Using only 21 IMU+GPS features, it achieves 93.91% accuracy, indicating practical deployment. Beyond PTW safety, the architecture shows better transferability to human activity (97.66%) and clinical (99.65%) domains. This lightweight framework advances PTW collision risk assessment, supporting the Safe System Approach for Intelligent Transportation Systems.
