# TLDChoiceNet: Quantitatively Choosing a Transfer Learning Dataset

## Abstract
Transfer learning is particularly useful in settings with limited training data, and within image classification it is common to transfer learn upon massive datasets like ImageNet , CIFAR-100, or COCO . Qualitatively, it seems a transfer learning dataset should have both more classes and more examples per class than the fine tuning dataset; however, a quantitative method to choose the best transfer learning dataset does not currently exist. In this paper, we design TLDChoiceNet, a model to choose the best transfer learning dataset given a fine tuning dataset by predicting the test-set accuracy after fine-tuning. A simple version 1 achieves 0.154 MSE on the test dataset, while a version 2 leveraging an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet50 v2 embedding with per-class information attains a 5X lower MSE of 0.031. We further design two metrics that enable an unsupervised method of choosing an optimal transfer learning dataset: distribution distance (DD), which linearly regresses against fine-tune accuracy with an R2 of 0.89, and average class correlation (ACC), which improves the R2 to 0.97. Our results underscore that a dataset's low-level statistics can explain the transfer learning effect, and that using a pre-trained ImageNet can embed different classes further apart in latent feature space.
