# Reasoning Before Translation: Enhancing Legal Machine Translation with Structured Reasoning

## Abstract
Neural machine translation (NMT) in the legal domain is a linguistically and conceptually demanding task, primarily due to the complexity of legal language and the high level of precision it requires. The recent emergence of reasoning-capable language models opens new possibilities for tackling such challenges. They add to a set of other previously proposed techniques to enhance the translation quality, which includes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.   In this work, we perform a comparison between these various approaches. More particularly, we evaluate small language models such as Qwen3.5 4B, Qwen3.5 9B, and Gemma 3 12B enhanced with various re-training paradigms and compare their performances against frontier reasoning models. We focus on the Swiss legal system, which -- with its unique multilingual statutes -- offers a particularly challenging testbed for reasoning-augmented models. Our results show that the quality of small ``base'' models can be greatly enhanced, and that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards can be applied to NMT in the legal domain and surpasses the translation quality of supervised fine-tuning. The performance of enhanced small models is close to the one of state-of-the-art reasoning models yet remains inferior. We also note that re-training paradigms yield diminishing returns as model size increase. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/aixiuxiuxiu/Legal-MT-SFT-RL.
