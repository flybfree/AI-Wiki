# Gradient Immunity: Null-Space Resistance to Malicious Fine-Tuning

## Abstract
Released aligned large language models remain vulnerable to malicious downstream finetuning. Existing defenses are largely designed for the fine-tuning-as-a-service (FTaaS) paradigm or rely on downstream users to follow additional safety procedures, and therefore do not directly address the setting we study: a provider controlled partially protected open-weight (PPOW) release setting in which most weights remain trainable while a small safety-critical component is preserved at release. We propose a Unidirectional Safety Gate (USG), instantiated as a Null Space Cubic Layer together with an Inverse Adapter inserted after the final Transformer layer. During downstream fine-tuning, the cubic layer suppresses or blocks gradients from harmful samples whose hidden states fall in a calibrated protected region, while the Inverse Adapter restores the base model's forward behavior. In practice, we calibrate a threshold using defender-held harmful data, allowing protection to generalize to nearby in-distribution harmful samples. Across six evaluated model-dataset settings, USG keeps post-finetuning attack success rate close to the pre-release level under a fixed release threshold, while maintaining high safe-pass rates on easier settings and exhibiting a clearer safety-utility trade-off on unsafe samples from BeaverTails. These results suggest that release-time representation-space blocking can raise the cost of malicious downstream adaptation without requiring downstream cooperation.
