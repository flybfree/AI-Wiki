# MEGA: Self-Evolving Agent Optimization Infrastructure via Wisdom Graph

## Abstract
As coding agents increasingly handle implementation, the central challenge shifts from building individual agents to building an infrastructure that systematically improves them. Current approaches optimize agent systems without accumulating transferable knowledge, accumulate knowledge without compositional reasoning over it, and lack a mechanism for that knowledge to self-evolve through operational evidence. MEGA (Meta Evaluation-Grounded Adaptation) addresses these gaps as a self-evolving infrastructure: each optimization cycle produces durable assets, compositional reasoning over those assets guides subsequent optimization, and operational evidence refines both the accumulated wisdom and the reasoning that governs it. Layer 1 distills reusable wisdom from agent sessions through behavioral-pattern clustering and empirical A/B validation, transforming each process into a durable asset. Layer 2 decomposes these assets into atomic PCR (Primary-Context-Resultant) units within a typed Wisdom Graph and performs deductive, abductive, and inductive reasoning to expand implicit relations; it then assembles context-specific execution plans through compositional retrieval that surfaces bridging knowledge unreachable by embedding similarity alone. Layer 3 performs multi-agent collaborative optimization over heterogeneous agent workflows (code nodes, LLM calls, and tool-using agents), attributing improvement effects to specific strategy changes through controlled evaluation that eliminates data variance. Evidence fed back from Layer 3 drives the self-evolution of both the curation strategies that govern wisdom composition and the optimization trajectories accumulated across runs. The result is an infrastructure in which optimizing an agent system and evolving the knowledge that guides optimization are one and the same process.
