# Structure-Preserving Uncertainty Propagation in First-Order Proof Search

## Abstract
GK is a query-directed first-order prover that extends ordinary resolution-based proof search with explicit positive and negative claims, numerical confidence values, and prioritized default rules with exceptions. It works directly with non-ground clauses, including equality and function terms. Candidate proofs are found by bounded first-order proof search; exception conditions of defaults are checked by further bounded searches, recursively when exceptions themselves depend on defaults. This avoids requiring a finite global grounding, while allowing incomplete searches to be reported as such.   This paper adds structure-preserving quantitative reporting to that framework. Retained proof histories are used in two calculations. The first reconstructs the uncertain ground premises used by each proof and computes the probability that at least one retained proof is available, without counting shared premises independently. The second resolves positive and negative support at intermediate atoms before that support is propagated through later rules; the same calculation evaluates uncertain exception conditions for individual rule applications. Reports separate positive support, negative support, conflict, and ignorance and identify detected incomplete calculations or fallbacks. The implementation performs bounded reconstruction and dependency traversal after proof search and still requires no global grounding. Analytic examples and independent simulators reproduce the reference calculations on their stated fragments. Comparisons with probabilistic logic, probabilistic ASP, default logic, and goal-directed ASP identify cases of agreement, semantic difference, unsupported translation, and incomplete computation.
