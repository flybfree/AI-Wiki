# VGGT-Align: Bridging Local Reconstruction and Global Consistency for Long-Sequence 3D Reconstruction

## Abstract
Maintaining global geometric consistency is a central challenge in long-sequence 3D reconstruction, with scale drift being the most critical failure mode. In chunk-based inference pipelines, the scale degree of freedom in sequential Sim(3) alignment is left unconstrained, causing estimation errors to compound multiplicatively and distort global trajectories and point cloud geometry. We present a scale-consistency enhancement framework built on a key insight: in structured environments such as driving scenes, geometric quantities arising from environmental regularity remain inherently invariant across temporal segments, and discrepancies in their per-chunk measurements directly expose inter-chunk scale drift. We propose Scene Geometric Invariant Anchoring (SGIA), which extracts dominant geometric invariants from each chunk's predicted point cloud via coarse-to-fine robust estimation and exploits their cross-chunk consistency to establish scale constraints independent of point cloud registration, explicitly degenerating 7-DoF Sim(3) alignment into 6-DoF rigid-body transformation and severing chain-wise scale error propagation at its source. We further introduce a lightweight test-time adaptation strategy that fine-tunes only normalization-layer parameters via multi-objective self-supervision, progressively improving intra-chunk predictions along the sequence. Both modules are plug-and-play and require no offline retraining. Experiments on multiple long-sequence benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing absolute trajectory error by up to 32% with significant gains in trajectory stability and reconstruction quality.
