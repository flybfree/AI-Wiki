# From Prompting to Behavioral Alignment: Personalized LLM Judges for Recommendation Evaluation

## Abstract
Traditional offline recommendation evaluation relies heavily on complex, manually maintained feature pipelines that are difficult to scale. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by predicting user engagement directly from raw text logs, empirical analysis in this study identifies a critical failure mode termed bidirectional rationalization. In a zero-shot setting, LLMs are found to convincingly argue for both positive and negative user engagement outcomes on the exact same item with identical evidence, highlighting the unreliability of off-the-shelf LLMs in predicting user engagement. To resolve this, we develop and apply a sequential behavioral alignment framework pairing fine-tuning with preference optimization over paired correct and counterfactual rationales. Evaluated on real-world homepage interaction logs, this aligned reasoning approach achieves a 32.19\% lift in Macro-F1 score over the zero-shot baseline and matches the production feature-engineered baseline. The results demonstrate that behavioral alignment mitigates bidirectional rationalization while delivering human-interpretable reasoning traces without manual pipeline overhead.
