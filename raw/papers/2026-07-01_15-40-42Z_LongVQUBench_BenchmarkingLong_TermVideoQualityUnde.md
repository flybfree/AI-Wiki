# LongVQUBench: Benchmarking Long-Term Video Quality Understanding of Vision-Language Models

## Abstract
The evaluation of long-term video quality understanding remains an open challenge for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Existing video quality benchmarks predominantly focus on short clips and isolated distortions, overlooking the temporal continuity, cumulative degradation, and reasoning complexity inherent in long-duration content. To address these limitations, we present LongVQUBench, a comprehensive benchmark for long-term video quality understanding. LongVQUBench contains over 1200 diverse videos spanning movies, documentaries, surveillance footage, egocentric recordings, and animated content, accompanied by 1500 multiple-choice and open-ended questions for validation and testing. To assess perceptual reasoning across different temporal scopes, we introduce three progressively complex evaluation levels: (i) local event quality understanding (LQU) for analyzing localized distortions; (ii) cross-event quality reasoning (CQR) for integrating multiple degraded events; and (iii) global quality understanding (GQU) for holistic perceptual evaluation over extended durations. Furthermore, a needle distortion question-answering (NDQA) paradigm is embedded across all three levels, where spatial or temporal artifacts are sparsely inserted to probe fine-grained detection and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on 14 state-of-the-art LVLMs reveal significant performance degradation with increasing video length and reasoning depth, highlighting their limited capacity for long-range temporal integration and perceptual attribution. We envision LongVQUBench as a foundational step toward the systematic, hierarchical, and explainable evaluation of LVLMs' long-term video quality understanding.
