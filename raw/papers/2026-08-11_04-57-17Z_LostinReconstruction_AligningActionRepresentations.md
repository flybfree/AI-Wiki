# Lost in Reconstruction: Aligning Action Representations with Language in Vision-Language-Action Models

## Abstract
Action verbs describe not only the physical outcomes of actions, but also how those actions are performed. Yet action representations in vision-language-action models (VLAs) are typically optimized for reconstruction under L1/L2 losses in raw action space, where numerical proximity need not reflect linguistically meaningful distinctions. On BridgeV2, we show that action trajectories contain verb-grounding information beyond visual state changes, and that reconstruction-only discrete tokenization systematically erodes this information. To address this problem, we introduce SALT, a Semantically ALigned action Tokenizer that augments a VQ-VAE-style tokenizer with an auxiliary objective requiring a frozen vision-language model to recover the episode instruction from quantized action latents. Policies trained with SALT achieve 71.9% average success in SimplerEnv, compared with 42.7% for a reconstruction-only VQ-VAE tokenizer and 31.2% for FAST. SALT also develops verb-specialized codes while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. These results show that robot action trajectories provide a source of language grounding and that preserving this structure in action representations can substantially improve language-conditioned control.
