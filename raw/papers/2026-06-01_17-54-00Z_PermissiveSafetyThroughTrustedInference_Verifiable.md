# Permissive Safety Through Trusted Inference: Verifiable Belief-Space Neural Safety Filters for Assured Interactive Robotics

## Abstract
Autonomous robots that interact with people must make safe and efficient decisions under human-induced uncertainty, such as their preferences, goals, competency, and willingness to cooperate. Safety filters are a popular approach for ensuring safety in interactive robotics, since their modular design separates safety from performance, allowing robots to operate safely around people with minimal impact on task efficiency. While traditional safety filters typically operate only in the physical space, neglecting the robot's ability to learn and adapt online, the recently proposed belief-space safety filter (BeliefSF) reasons about robot safety in closed-loop with runtime inference that actively reduces the robot's uncertainty online, thereby reducing conservativeness in filtering. However, providing formal safety guarantees for robots deploying BeliefSF remains a significant challenge due to errors in runtime inference and neural approximation of safety filters required to handle the high dimensionality of belief spaces. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic approach to certify high-probability safety of BeliefSF using conformal prediction, while explicitly accounting for the reliability of the robot's runtime inference module. Our method leverages the structure of belief-space safety filtering by focusing verification on a region where inference is expected to be reliable. It preserves the simplicity and sample complexity of standard conformal prediction, yet can certify a substantially less conservative safety filter. Through a simulated human-vehicle interaction benchmark, we show that our approach verifies a significantly more permissive belief-space safety filter than a standard conformal prediction baseline.
