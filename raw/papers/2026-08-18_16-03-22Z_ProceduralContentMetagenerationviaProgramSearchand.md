# Procedural Content Metageneration via Program Search and Continual Abstraction Discovery

## Abstract
Large language models can generate executable programs, which makes it possible to search directly over procedural content generators rather than individual levels. We study this approach in Sokoban, Zelda, Dangerous Dave, and Lode Runner. Each run evolves complete Python generators through language-model mutation and crossover. We introduce Continual Abstraction Discovery, or CAD, which extracts reusable primitives from high-fitness programs into a run-specific helper module. A 2x2 experiment crosses CAD with access to a fixed hand-written domain API. The completed data set contains 160 complete runs, with at least ten 50-generation runs in every cell. CAD raises mean final best fitness in all eight domain and API comparisons. Across all CAD runs, learned libraries are adopted by most later programs and repeatedly rediscover validation, reachability, and structural utilities. These results support that discovering reusable primitives improves evolutionary program search for content generators.
