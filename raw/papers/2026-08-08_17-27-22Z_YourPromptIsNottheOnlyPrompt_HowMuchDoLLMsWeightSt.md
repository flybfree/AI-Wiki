# Your Prompt Is Not the Only Prompt: How Much Do LLMs Weight Structured-Output Schema Descriptions?

## Abstract
Structured output, where an LLM populates a predefined JSON schema, has become a default mechanism for data labeling and information extraction, but it also introduces a second instruction channel through schema descriptions. We tested whether classification-label definitions are better placed in the system prompt, user prompt, or schema description using a single-field classification task with nonce labels across ten model configurations from two vendors. Schema descriptions did not consistently outperform prompt-based placement; for GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.4 without reasoning, schema placement underperformed system prompts by 11-13 percentage points. Yet schemas are not inert metadata: when prompts and schemas conflicted, incorrect schema instructions caused accuracy drops of 5-45 points, with Claude Haiku 4.5 falling from 52.5% to 7%, indicating that schema instructions can override prompt instructions, and GPT-5.5 falling from 100% to 73%. Further, adding a required intermediate reasoning field before the label field improved schema-only accuracy by 15-24 points when headroom existed, exceeding system-prompt-only performance in every case tested. The effect held even for Claude Sonnet 4.6 at medium reasoning, where extended thinking alone did not produce a comparable gain. This suggests that schema design can affect how effectively models use information encoded in field descriptions. Overall, these results indicate that schema influence is model-dependent. In practice, the system prompt remains a safe default for definitions, but the bigger discipline is maintaining a single source of truth and preventing prompt/schema drift. More importantly, schema design itself may be a stronger lever than instruction placement. Practitioners should treat prompts and schemas as a unified instruction surface and empirically validate both placement and field design for their target model.
