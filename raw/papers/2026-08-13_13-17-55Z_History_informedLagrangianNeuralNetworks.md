# History-informed Lagrangian Neural Networks

## Abstract
Forecasting the long-horizon evolution of mechanical systems from position-only observations is a pivotal yet difficult task, as hidden velocities and trajectory-specific physical properties must be inferred simultaneously. Although physics-guided neural networks like Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) guarantee physical plausibility, they generally require complete state inputs and lack adaptability to changing system parameters. To break these limitations, we introduce History-informed Lagrangian Neural Networks (HiLNN). Grounded in the insight that temporal position sequences implicitly encode underlying dynamics, HiLNN employs a recurrent encoder to extract a latent context from history. This context not only reconstructs the unobserved initial velocity but also adaptively modulates the mass matrix, potential energy, and damping coefficients of a structured Lagrangian system. By leveraging a differentiable RK4 rollout scheme, the entire pipeline is optimized end-to-end under multi-step trajectory supervision and energy-consistency regularization. Empirical evaluations across conservative, dissipative, and heterogeneous variable-parameter systems show that HiLNN delivers superior long-term prediction accuracy and maintains precise energy profiles compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
