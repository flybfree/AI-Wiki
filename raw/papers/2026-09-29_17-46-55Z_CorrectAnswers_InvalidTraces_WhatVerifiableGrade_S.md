# Correct Answers, Invalid Traces: What Verifiable Grade-School Math Reveals About Chain-of-Thought Traces

## Abstract
Chain-of-thought traces are widely read as records of how models reach their answers, informing debugging, agent auditing, and claims about reasoning. Testing this interpretation is difficult because natural-language thinking traces are rarely mechanically verifiable. We revisit it in iGSM, a synthetic grade-school mathematics benchmark designed to study thinking traces and used to support claims of learned reasoning and planning. Crucially, iGSM exposes the exact quantities and dependencies that a correct solution should use, allowing generated traces to be checked programmatically step by step and enabling us to test whether correct answers are reliably accompanied by valid traces. We first evaluate models trained exclusively on valid, minimal traces. Answer correctness and trace validity nearly coincide in distribution but decouple out of distribution: on the hardest instances, 31.6% of correct answers have invalid traces, over half of which pass all syntactic and arithmetic checks but fail semantic dependency checks. We then intervene on trace supervision. Non-minimal training traces induce non-minimal outputs, while re-asking the same problem with a different query reveals computations inherited from the original query, weakening minimality as evidence of selective planning. Shuffling tokens in 10% of training trace sentences preserves near-clean accuracy even out of distribution despite no trace passing verification. Swapped training traces likewise retain high in-distribution accuracy. We discuss the implications of these findings for chain-of-thought monitoring and interpretation in the context of AI safety.
