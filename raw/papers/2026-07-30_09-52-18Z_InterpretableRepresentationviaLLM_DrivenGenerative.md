# Interpretable Representation via LLM-Driven Generative Disentanglement for Local-Life Service Recommendation

## Abstract
While large language models (LLMs) have advanced ID-based recommendation through Semantic ID (SID) modeling, existing SID generation frameworks largely follow a single-representation-then-quantization paradigm. This design faces two bottlenecks: semantic entanglement mixes heterogeneous attributes, such as geography, brand, and category, causing information loss during quantization, low-quality SIDs, and severe collisions; moreover, black-box representation learning provides neither explicit attribute semantics nor clear geographic or semantic meanings for SID positions. These limitations weaken both retrieval reliability and the ability to diagnose or control SID generation. We propose Interpretable Representation via LLM-Driven Generative Disentanglement for Local-Life Service Recommendation (LGRID). LGRID introduces a generative disentanglement paradigm through an Encode -> Disentangle -> Align -> Quantize pipeline. It first uses joint LLM encoding to preserve cross-attribute geographic-semantic dependencies, rather than encoding fields independently. A Structured Disentangled Block then routes hidden states into attribute-aligned slots for geographic and semantic factors. Synergistic Alignment Learning makes these slots both generatively decodable and discriminative for retrieval, while Dual-Stream Residual Quantization separately discretizes the two streams into compact SIDs with explicit attribute correspondence. This design yields interpretable SIDs with positions grounded in item attributes and local-service semantics. Experiments on Kuaishou and Foursquare show that LGRID consistently outperforms strong SID baselines, achieving up to a 5.44 percent relative AUC gain. It also achieves over 99 percent attribute-decoding accuracy for coarse geographic fields and reduces the full-SID collision rate to 39.9 percent, compared with 97.0 percent for LGSID.
