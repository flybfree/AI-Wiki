# SurveyReview: A Reviewer-Aligned Benchmark for Survey Evaluators

## Abstract
The rapid advancement of large language models has transformed survey writing from a months-long manual effort into an automated process. As generation scales, reliable evaluation becomes the bottleneck, and LLMs are increasingly used as survey evaluators. However, existing approaches largely rely on off-the-shelf LLM-as-a-judge methods without systematic alignment to human reviewers, and there remains a lack of systematic frameworks for quantifying alignment with human reviewers. To address this gap, we propose SurveyReview, a reviewer-aligned, multi-dimensional benchmark and dataset for survey evaluation. We collect and annotate 675 survey papers with 1,630 review reports. We structure authentic peer-review reports by converting free-form comments into four-dimensional scores (Readability, Criticalness, Comprehensiveness, Structure) paired with supporting rationales. We further release standardized train/test splits and an evaluation protocol to measure alignment between automatic evaluators and human reviewers. To validate the benchmark, we develop SurveyAlign, a strong baseline evaluator by fine-tuning Qwen3-32B with LoRA on our annotated data, augmented with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive dimensions. On the test set, SurveyAlign substantially improves reviewer alignment over prompt-based judging with GPT-5.2, reducing average MSE from 2.28 to 1.38 and MAE from 1.15 to 0.69 across all four dimensions. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we establish the first multi-dimensional, reviewer-aligned dataset with a reproducible evaluation framework for survey reviewing; (2) we develop a strong baseline evaluator that substantially improves alignment with human reviewers, providing a competitive reference for future research. Our code and data are available at https://surveyreview.github.io
