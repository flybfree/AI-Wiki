# Don't Scroll Back: Missing-Evidence Memory for Streaming Dialogue Summarization

## Abstract
Users of modern platforms repeatedly need summaries of recent dialogue, but the window rarely contains enough context to be interpreted on its own. We formalize this setting as streaming dialogue summarization, where a system must summarize a current window using selective memory from an unbounded history under a fixed budget. We show that the central challenge is not how much history is accessed, but whether memory recovers the evidence that the current window presupposes. We construct a benchmark and evaluation protocol that separately assesses whether memory contains gap-resolving evidence and whether the generated summary reflects it. We propose ReMEMBER, a missing-evidence memory framework that conditions retrieval on unresolved window dependencies and refines retrieved chunks into evidence-dense memory under a fixed budget. Experiments on dialogues with histories up to 160K tokens show that ReMEMBER improves memory recall and gap-resolution completeness over memory construction baselines under the same budget.
