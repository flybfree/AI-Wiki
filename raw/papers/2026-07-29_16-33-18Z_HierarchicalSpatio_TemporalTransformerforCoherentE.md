# Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Coherent Emergency Department Forecasting

## Abstract
Emergency Departments (EDs) are critical access points in healthcare systems, yet they face persistent pressure from unpredictable patient demand, seasonal surges, and non-urgent visits. Effective ED planning requires forecasts at multiple decision-making levels: hospitals need local demand estimates for staffing and bed management, regions require forecasts to coordinate healthcare units, and national authorities need system-wide projections for capacity planning. However, most existing approaches forecast ED demand independently at a single level, ignoring the hierarchy linking hospitals, regions, and national systems. This can produce incoherent predictions, where hospital-level forecasts do not aggregate consistently to regional or national demand. We propose HierSTT, a hierarchical Transformer-based framework for coherent multi-level ED forecasting. HierSTT jointly predicts hospital, regional, and national level demand in a single end-to-end model. A Temporal Fusion Transformer captures national dynamics, while spatio-temporal Transformer encoder-decoder modules model regional and hospital demand conditioned on higher-level forecasts. A coherence-aware loss penalizes cross-level inconsistencies during training. We further introduce a nationwide Portuguese ED dataset covering 81 hospitals across 5 regional health administrations, with heterogeneous covariates at each level. Experiments show that HierSTT reduces average WAPE by 32\% relative to the best non-hierarchical deep learning baseline and outperforms all classical hierarchical reconciliation methods, while producing near-coherent predictions across levels.
