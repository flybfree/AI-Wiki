# Guardian Crawler: Retrieval-First Knowledge Discovery with Bounded LLM Augmentation for Noisy Web Intelligence

## Abstract
Retrieving relevant evidence from noisy web data is challenging, particularly in sensitive domains containing incomplete reports, heterogeneous language, and irrelevant content. We present Guardian Crawler, a reproducible retrieval-first testbed for controlled experiments on knowledge discovery and evidence-grounded summarization over synthetic web-like corpora. The architecture combines BM25 retrieval with risk-aware, embedding-augmented, and hybrid reranking, followed by constrained retrieval-augmented generation with explicit document citations. Experiments on a synthetic 900-document corpus and 10 queries produced the highest descriptive retrieval scores under risk-based reranking, with P@10 = 1.00 and NDCG@10 = 0.94, compared with 0.94 and 0.81 for BM25. The best hybrid and BM25+Semantic configurations reached NDCG@10 values of 0.94 and 0.88, respectively. All 41 evaluable generated bullets passed the lexical coverage threshold; an automated LLM judge classified 36 as supported, one as partially supported, and four as unsupported. These results demonstrate the feasibility of Guardian Crawler as a controlled testbed but do not establish statistical superiority, human-validated faithfulness, or transfer to live-web investigative environments.
