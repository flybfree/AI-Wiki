# Open-Set Visual Text Forensics via Sparse-Constraint Rectified Flow

## Abstract
Rapidly evolving Generative AI enables sophisticated visual text manipulations that increasingly evade current forensic detectors. Existing discriminative models often overfit specific forgery patterns, limiting their generalization to unseen, open-set attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a generative detector that localizes tampering by estimating the local restoration cost required to align a query image with authentic visual-text statistics, rather than by learning forgery-specific decision boundaries. Specifically, we introduce Sparse-Constraint Rectified Flow (SC-RF), a detector-oriented adaptation of Flow Matching for spatially sparse anomaly localization. We further mitigate data scarcity via self-supervised Artifact Injection and preserve high-frequency forensic traces using a pixel-space Forensic-DiT. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the runner-up by 3.2 and 4.8 percentage points in F1 and IoU, respectively. In particular, the proposed detector demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on challenging unseen text editing patterns. We further provide an auxiliary stress-test analysis showing that local harmonization produced by our model can weaken the statistical cues relied upon by existing detectors, offering a complementary vulnerability-analysis perspective.
