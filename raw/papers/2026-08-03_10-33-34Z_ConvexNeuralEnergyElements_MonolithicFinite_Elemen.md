# Convex Neural Energy Elements: Monolithic Finite-Element Assembly of Geometry-Parameterized Neural Operators with Stability and Error Guarantees

## Abstract
Extending the neural-operator element method from individually trained, fixed-geometry neural elements to a library of reusable, geometry-parameterized element types fails structurally: a field-predicting operator trained by value regression induces an energy whose assembled Hessian is indefinite, and Newton converges to spurious minima (247% error) even with 1%-accurate field predictions. We introduce convex neural energy elements: each element exports a scalar energy E(g,U), architecturally convex in its boundary degrees of freedom U and smoothly parameterized by its geometry g, realized as a hypernetwork-generated positive-semidefinite quadratic form (an input-convex correction is reserved for non-quadratic physics). A regularization-nullspace principle--the regularizer's nullspace must contain the physics nullspace--removes an otherwise irreducible bias, and assembled elements inherit the classical guarantee that singular element stiffnesses yield a positive-definite global system. We prove conditional error bounds (energy-to-solution accuracy, element-count scaling, geometry generalization) and verify each experimentally. On heat conduction with elliptic holes, one trained element assembles into 2x2 to 8x8 grids and an L-shaped layout of unseen geometries at 0.6-1.0% relative L2 error, with 175x faster per-geometry setup for boundary-quantity workloads. A second trained element type mixes freely with the first in one monolithic assembly, and a three-dimensional instantiation reaches 0.23% on eight-element assemblies--the guarantees are type- and dimension-agnostic. A plane-strain elasticity element, whose physics nullspace is three-dimensional, lands on the analytically predicted regularization floors. Making the energy the learned object turns neural operators from single-use surrogates into reusable elements that inherit the assembly guarantees of the method they extend.
