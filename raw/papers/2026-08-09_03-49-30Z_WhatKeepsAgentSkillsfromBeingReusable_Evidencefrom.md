# What Keeps Agent Skills from Being Reusable? Evidence from 138K SKILL.md Files

## Abstract
Under the current standard, Agent Skills are SKILL.md files that combine instructions with supporting resources, enabling Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reuse procedures beyond a single conversation. Yet many public skills appear to originate from a single task, repository, or conversation, even when they are shared as reusable components. We analyze this gap across 138,133 public SKILL.md files from 20,556 repositories using a two-tier defect taxonomy grounded in the official specification and best-practice guidance. We find that 91.8% of skills contain at least one detected defect, with stable estimates across lenient and strict thresholds (88.8-94.6%). The dominant failures are ordinary packaging problems rather than exotic attacks: weak routing metadata, bloated or non-actionable bodies, and poor resource organization. A deterministic routing stress test over 20,000 skills shows the functional impact: skills with valid routing metadata are retrieved more reliably from startup descriptions than skills with routing defects. Defect rates vary by platform and provenance: specification-aware skills contain fewer defects, while AI-marked skills show more safety and portability problems. Lightweight enforcement and repair experiments support a quality-assured generation workflow combining spec-aware prompting, lightweight linting, automated repair, and safety gating.
