# X-KGRank: A Knowledge Graph RAG Framework for Explainable Recommendations via Pattern Mining and LLM Re-Ranking

## Abstract
Modern recommender systems produce predictions that users cannot interrogate. The two dominant improvements, collaborative filtering and LLM-based reasoning, each fall short: collaborative filtering captures behavioural signals but offers no reasoning, while large language models (LLMs) generate fluent explanations but hallucinate and are poorly grounded in a user's history. We present X-KGRank, a knowledge graph retrieval augmented framework that unifies structural collaborative filtering with LLM-based explanation. From the MovieLens-1M dataset (6,040 users, 3,704 items, 988,129 interactions) we construct a heterogeneous knowledge graph of 9,762 nodes and 999,264 edges spanning three relation types (RATED, HAS_GENRE, and CO_RATED) persisted in Neo4j. We train a LightGCN ranker with content-aware SBERT initialization and a rating weighted BPR objective, and apply a popularity selective routing strategy that grounds long-tail items (1,855 of 3,704) in knowledge-graph paths while serving popular items from pre-trained knowledge, reducing KG-augmented generations by roughly 50%. On the MovieLens-1M test set under a 99-sample protocol, X-KGRank achieves NDCG@10 = 0.2956 and Recall@10 = 0.5371, improving over a strong popularity baseline by 17.1% on both metrics, by 15.6% on NDCG@20 (0.3449 vs. 0.2983), and by 14.6% on MRR (0.2435 vs. 0.2124). Across three LLM backbones evaluated on 16 cases, a 1.5-billion-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) matches a 7-billion-parameter model (Mistral-7B) on heuristic explanation quality (0.97 vs. 0.94), yet qualitative analysis shows the smaller model is more prone to factual fabrication.
