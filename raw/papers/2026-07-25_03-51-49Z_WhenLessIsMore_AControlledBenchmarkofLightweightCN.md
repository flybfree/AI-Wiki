# When Less Is More: A Controlled Benchmark of Lightweight CNNs for Satellite Land-Cover Segmentation on DeepGlobe

## Abstract
High-resolution satellite imagery is the backbone of good land-cover classification, and without that, environmental monitoring, urban planning, and sustainable resource management all fall short. Deep learning architectures perform well in semantic segmentation, but the efficiency-accuracy trade-off across classical convolutional encoders is not well quantified under controlled, reproducible conditions. This study compares five architectures VGG16, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, AlexNet, and CNN on the DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification dataset using three progressively optimized iterations to isolate regularisation, transfer learning, and architectural depth. To ensure performance differentials reflect architectural properties, all experiments used identical preprocessing, hyperparameter, and training protocols without data augmentation or class-imbalance correction. At 24.98 MB, MobileNetV2_v1 had the highest overall accuracy (0.7906) and mean Intersection over Union (0.4625), outperforming deeper alternatives like InceptionV3_v2 (125.17 MB, accuracy 0.7610) and VGG16_v2 (71.13 MB, accuracy 0.7653). Class-wise analysis showed strength in urban, agricultural, and water categories, but rangeland-barren confusion showed that architectural optimization alone cannot optimize spectrally similar minority classes. Strong spatial generalization and crisp boundary delineation were confirmed on held-out test imagery, validating operational applicability. These results show that lightweight, transfer-learned models can match or outperform deeper models in resource-constrained remote-sensing environments, enabling scalable land-cover mapping.
