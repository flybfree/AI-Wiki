# Proton Irradiation Characterization of an Open-Source ML Accelerator on a Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC

## Abstract
As spaceborne computing systems increasingly rely on neural network (NN) accelerators, the opacity of commercial, black-box architectures severely restricts the development of verifiable radiation mitigation strategies. Open-source, register-transfer level (RTL)-accessible accelerators resolve this limitation by enabling user-defined instrumentation, yet few have empirical radiation-response baselines. This work establishes a foundational system-level proton-irradiation baseline for an unmitigated open-source Tensil NN accelerator deployed on a Zynq UltraScale+ SoC executing ResNet-20 inference. Under 20 to 58 MeV proton irradiation, we delivered $4.29 \times 10^{10}$ p/cm$^{2}$ within monitored operational windows. Seven workload interruptions required two restarts of the notebook process, four reboots or board resets, and one power-cycle sequence. Two output-corruption events returned incorrect CIFAR-10 classes without loss of service. In the longer event, the accelerator returned a class absent from the ten-image CIFAR-10 pool for 39 consecutive inputs at normal cadence. The process remained alive, while the kernel log, limited memory test, and sampled power showed no anomaly. Observation of the stuck-class sequence ended with scheduled bitstream reconfiguration. All nine onsets occurred under the nominal 4 cm beam, which exposed the SoC, LPDDR4, and additional board circuitry; none occurred under the 2 cm SoC-centered field. This pattern shows a field association but does not establish LPDDR4 as the cause because field size was confounded with run order and dose. Linux-managed accelerators require end-to-end content checks and recovery that reaches the state in which corruption can persist. This baseline documents availability loss and silent output corruption, supporting future software hardening of COTS FPGA-SoCs for neural-network inference in space systems.
