# VLAQuantBench: Closed-Loop Evaluation of Post-Training Quantization for Vision-Language-Action Models

## Abstract
Post-training quantization reduces the memory requirements of vision-language-action (VLA) models, but precision selection must account for the interaction between layer scope, numerical format, and calibration. We introduce \textbf{VLAQuantBench}, a controlled evaluation with 409 runs and 94,574 simulation episodes: four models on LIBERO, with X-VLA additionally evaluated on three simulation benchmark families. Under uncalibrated W4A4 round-to-nearest quantization, expanding a $π_{0.5}$ action-head subset from 126 to 167 layers raises success from 7.0\% to 70.5\%. Fixed-observation replay confirms a corresponding numerical recovery. Two-episode calibration removes the severe joint failures in the tested subsets, whereas the same smoothing-and-clipping recipe lowers $π_0$ success and does not recover OpenVLA-OFT end-to-end. For OpenVLA-OFT, protecting one 28,672-parameter output projection instead restores near-baseline success: the remaining 441 eligible linear layers retain W3 on LIBERO-Long or eight-bit activations across all four suites. Task-clustered intervals support the large failure and recovery contrasts. These results establish recipe-dependent interactions and identify concrete precision assignments, rather than universal layer-sensitivity rules. Real-kernel and physical-robot measurements complement the accuracy analysis. Code, configurations, and episode records are publicly available at https://github.com/jiuyixu25/VLAQuantBench.
