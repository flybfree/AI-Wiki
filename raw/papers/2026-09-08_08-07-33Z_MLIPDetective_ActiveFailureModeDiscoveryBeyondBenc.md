# MLIP Detective: Active Failure Mode Discovery Beyond Benchmark Scores for Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials

## Abstract
Universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (u-MLIPs) aim to generalize across diverse configurations. Benchmarks enable reproducible evaluation but may not expose failures outside their predefined scope. Here, we show that physics-informed search can complement benchmark-based evaluation by uncovering hidden failure modes. We introduce MLIP Detective, an agentic framework for active failure mode discovery. Starting from benchmark evidence, MLIP Detective generates falsifiable, physics-informed failure hypotheses, screens them with inexpensive simulations, and escalates only the most suspicious cases to human experts together with proposed verification protocols. Without issue-specific prompting, MLIP Detective identified and characterized a systematic anomaly in MACE-MPA-0: the model predicted some relaxed adsorbate-surface systems involving O- or F-containing adsorbates to be higher in energy than their corresponding separated fragments. Using cross-model comparisons, MLIP Detective further inferred a likely training-data origin for the anomaly, consistent with recent reports.
