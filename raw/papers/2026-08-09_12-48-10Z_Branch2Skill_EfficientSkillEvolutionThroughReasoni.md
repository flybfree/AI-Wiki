# Branch2Skill: Efficient Skill Evolution Through Reasoning Trees

## Abstract
Skill evolution improves agent skills through feedback over time, with failed trajectories often providing informative signals by revealing incomplete or misleading behaviors. However, existing methods mainly rely on single trajectories, where early reasoning errors can propagate through subsequent steps and weaken the feedback available for skill refinement. Consequently, improving skills requires repeated cycles of rollout, diagnosis, and update, incurring substantial token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce Branch2Skill, an efficient framework that transforms a single reasoning tree into dense supervision for skill evolution. For each task or problem, Branch2Skill performs Monte Carlo tree search under a fixed budget to obtain diverse reasoning trajectories, then compares an elite path with sibling alternatives sharing the same prefixes to extract step-wise evidence about which reasoning patterns to retain, revise, or avoid. Finally, Branch2Skill distills multi-step evidence into reusable updates, allowing one reasoning tree to provide supervision across multiple reasoning steps and reducing the need for repeated rollout-update cycles. Across six benchmarks covering reasoning and agentic tasks, Branch2Skill consistently improves task performance while enhancing skill evolution efficiency. For example, with GPT 5.5 as the target model, Branch2Skill uses 73.2% fewer tokens than SkillOpt, while achieving superior performance. These results demonstrate that reasoning trees can support not only more effective trajectory search, but also richer supervision for more efficient skill improvement. Code will be published.
