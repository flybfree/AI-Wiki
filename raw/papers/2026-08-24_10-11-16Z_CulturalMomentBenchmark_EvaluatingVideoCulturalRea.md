# Cultural Moment Benchmark: Evaluating Video Cultural Reasoning and Grounding in Southeast Asia

## Abstract
Cultural understanding in video means more than recognizing what is visible; it requires grasping the symbolic and temporal significance of cultural concepts. We decompose this into three abilities: naming what a concept symbolizes, visually recognizing it on video, and locating its sub-events in time. Existing video-cultural benchmarks tend to test what is seen, collapsing these three abilities into a single score that hides the bottleneck. We introduce the Cultural Moment Benchmark (CMB): 306 expert-curated concepts from seven countries in Southeast Asia across five categories. We evaluate each concept through three stages, one per ability. Given a description, Stage 1 (S1) selects from four candidate concept names, Stage 2 (S2) selects from four candidate video moments, and Stage 3 (S3) predicts the start and end times of the moment in a video. To keep each stage focused on a distinct ability, we use three design choices: semantic-similarity distractors (S1, S2), unlabeled video moments (S2), and free-form localization on a different example video (S3). Across six vision-language models, failure modes vary by ability and modality. i) Even the strongest closed-source models score below 30% when all three stages must be correct; ii) The three abilities do not fully cascade: naming a concept correctly helps half the models recognize it on video, but recognizing it has little effect on locating the sub-event in time; iii) Audio is complementary, redundant, or distracting depending on the concept, more often distracting in non-Latin-script countries; removing both audio and subtitles hurts Games and Music the most. Our 14-rater human study shows that even Expert raters score below chance on concepts from a neighboring country, indicating that CMB requires country-specific cultural knowledge. CMB acts as a diagnostic harness, attributing failures to a specific ability or modality.
