# Stale, Misattributed, or Late: Where Personal Memory Fails Before Generation

## Abstract
Personal memory for language agents is usually judged by whether the final an- swer is correct. That score hides errors that arise before generation: the memory block may contain an obsolete value, a fact about the wrong person, or no use- ful fact before the serving deadline. We measure these failures directly. Using Personal Fact Memory (PFM) as a reference layer, we find that temporal validity is primarily a property of memory construction in our setting. On a controlled revision benchmark, serving only the active value of each correctly keyed slot eliminates observed stale exposure; without update resolution, 70.3% of prompts expose a superseded value. Once retrievers share the same active store and par- ticipant information, participant-aware BM25 is equivalent to the reference ranker within a prespecified 0.02 margin. The harder problem is assigning revisions to the right slot. Missed merges leave stale values active, whereas false merges silently remove current values; four LLM key assigners achieve higher key re- call than a rule extractor yet produce lower clean-retrieval rates, and open-domain merge recall on LongMemEval never exceeds 0.062. Misattribution survives va- lidity filtering: an entity posterior reduces same-name exposure on controlled data but cannot distinguish identically named speakers in LoCoMo. Two frozen lan- guage models reproduce prompt errors in generated text. Retrieval latency varies across rankers, but prompt prefill dominates turn-level latency on our hardware. These results argue for evaluating agent memory before generation, separating stored-state validity, identity resolution, abstention, and serving latency.
