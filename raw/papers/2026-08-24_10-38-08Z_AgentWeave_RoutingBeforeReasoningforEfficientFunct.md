# AgentWeave: Routing Before Reasoning for Efficient Function Calling in Tool-Rich Language Models

## Abstract
Large language models increasingly operate over large collections of tools, functions, APIs, and specialized agents. As the candidate action space grows, a function-calling model must process more schemas, consume more prompt tokens, and distinguish among increasingly similar or irrelevant alternatives. We study a complementary systems strategy: reduce the candidate set before language-model inference while leaving the downstream model unchanged. We introduce AgentWeave, a deterministic pre-inference routing layer that constructs a bounded model-visible action space using eligibility, requirement, capability, and routing signals. We evaluate AgentWeave with a frozen BFCL-derived routing-pressure protocol using the public MadeAgents/Hammer2.1-1.5b model. On 48 fresh BFCL V4 multiple-function tasks, AgentWeave achieves 6/48 (12.5%) native BFCL successes, whereas all-tools, deterministic random top-8, and semantic top-8 baselines each achieve 0/48. The paired success difference is +12.5 percentage points with a 10,000-resample paired bootstrap 95% confidence interval of +4.17 to +22.92 points and exact McNemar p=0.03125. Relative to all-tools exposure, AgentWeave presents 70.18% fewer tools, uses 61.70% fewer input tokens, and exhibits 50.95% lower mean local-model latency. The result is deliberately narrow: this is a BFCL-derived routing-pressure study rather than an official full BFCL leaderboard score, and absolute task success remains low. The evidence nevertheless shows that candidate-space construction can materially affect a fixed model's function-calling behavior and motivates evaluating routing as a distinct stage before model reasoning.
