# SyzHarness: Patch-Based Kernel Bug Reproduction with LLM-Synthesized Fuzzing Harnesses

## Abstract
Automated kernel vulnerability reproduction is essential for bug triage, patch validation, and regression testing, but   still lacks an effective and efficient solution. The core challenge is twofold: a reproducer must first recover the   trigger scaffold needed to reach the vulnerable state and determine the precise concrete values that actually trigger   the bug. Existing directed fuzzing approaches are ineffective at recovering the necessary trigger scaffold, while LLM-   only generation is brittle because it struggles with concrete-value discovery and runtime nondeterminism. We design   SyzHarness, a framework that combines LLM reasoning with coverage-guided fuzzing for patch-based Linux kernel   vulnerability reproduction. Given a patch, SyzHarness uses an LLM agent grounded by code navigation tools to   synthesize a parameterized fuzzing harness that fixes the prerequisite setup logic while exposing only uncertain, bug-   critical input parameters to be mutated by Syzkaller. SyzHarness then translates this harness into a Syzkaller-   compatible interface and iteratively refines it using hierarchical reachability feedback. We evaluate SyzHarness on   multiple datasets of triggerable real-world Linux kernel vulnerabilities. On 100 KernelCTF cases, SyzHarness achieves   a 78% bug reproduction success rate. On the SyzDirect benchmark, SyzHarness achieves a 73% bug reproduction success   rate, substantially outperforming prior directed greybox fuzzing. On 50 recent, known-triggerable syzbot bugs fixed   after March 2026, SyzHarness reproduces 40/50 (80%) using only the fix commits as input.
