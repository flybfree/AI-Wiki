# Dynamic Topic Modeling for Cross-Corpus Temporal Analysis

## Abstract
Dynamic Embedded Topic Models (D-ETM) provide an interpretable framework for modeling temporal semantic evolution, but cross-corpus comparison remains difficult because topics are often learned independently and aligned only after training, a process that does not guarantee stable topic correspondence across corpora and time. To address this problem, we propose a D-ETM framework that first learns a common dynamic topic space over a merged multi-corpus collection, which we call the shared backbone, then introduces corpus-specific residual adaptation around the frozen backbone without creating separate latent topic spaces. This design preserves a shared topic index for cross-corpus comparison while allowing each corpus to specialize lexically. We evaluate the framework on three temporally structured corpora spanning 97 years: the Corpus of Historical American English, Harvard Business Review, and International Labour Review. Residual adaptation improves corpus-specific fit relative to the shared backbone while preserving the same-index cross-corpus topic trajectories, achieving substantially stronger alignment than full fine-tuning from the same backbone, with $97.5 \pm 0.7\%$ versus $17.9 \pm 1.1\%$ trajectory Retrieval@1, as well as stronger alignment than independent training with post-hoc Hungarian matching. These results suggest that incorporating topic alignment into the model can support more stable over-time cross-corpus comparisons while retaining corpus-specific lexical variation.
