# ModelEquivBench: Certifying Multi-Relational Evaluation of LLM-Generated Optimization Models

## Abstract
Large language models increasingly generate optimization models from natural language, but existing evaluation often reduces a generated model and its ground truth to a single equivalent/not-equivalent verdict or an execution-success rate--labels that are neither independently checkable nor faithful to the multiple distinct senses in which two formulations can agree. We present ModelEquivBench, a certifying, multi-relational evaluation system that reports a per-pair semantic profile E0--E6: model construction and exact ingestion (E0), verified representation alignment (E1), same-space and projected feasible-set relations (E2, E3), objective-order equivalence (E4), optimal-value equality (E5), and optimizer-set equivalence (E6). Each decided entry carries relation-appropriate, independently re-checkable evidence: replayable traces or explicit maps for E0--E1, exact-rational certificates for positive E2--E6 conclusions, and explicit witnesses for supported negatives. Incomplete mapping search, unsupported structure, and resource limits produce typed UNKNOWN or N/A outcomes rather than guesses, while unmet prerequisites are reported as ABSENT. Using ModelEquivBench to evaluate three model snapshots--GPT-5.4, Claude Sonnet 4.6, and Qwen3.5-397B-A17B--on the same frozen cohort of 173 base problems (346 cells per model) under a no-repair protocol, the resulting profiles expose distinctions that coarse baselines do not represent: 49, 35, and 25 cells contain executable candidates that are nevertheless certified negative on at least one supported relation, and 25, 8, and 18 structural rejections occur on pairs for which E2 certifies mapped feasible-set equality under a verified map. The three model snapshots fail at different stages of the profile and therefore cannot be meaningfully reduced to a single accuracy score.
