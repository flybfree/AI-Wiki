# DualSpectralCF: Training-Free Sign-Aware Spectral Collaborative Filtering

## Abstract
Real-world recommendation platforms routinely collect explicit negative feedback such as 1-star reviews, hate-button clicks, distrust between users, and very-low watch-ratio videos. Learned sign-aware recommenders exploit this signal for clear accuracy gains, but only at the cost of gradient-based training. In parallel, a line of training-free spectral collaborative filtering methods matches or beats learned graph recommenders at a fraction of the cost, yet operates on positive interactions alone. We bridge these two lines with DualSpectralCF, a training-free framework of two components that attach to any spectral backbone of the form $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_u = F(\mathbf{M}) \mathbf{r}_u$: a signed input signal $\mathbf{r}_u^{\pm}$ that encodes the user's explicit dislikes, and a signed item-item operator $\mathbf{M}^{\pm}$ that blends like-together and dislike-together similarity. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds just two scalar hyperparameters. We instantiate DualSpectralCF on ChebyCF, GF-CF, and Turbo-CF, and evaluate on five sign-aware benchmarks: every instance matches or beats its unsigned backbone on all 5 datasets, with Recall@20 lifts up to +32.6% with backbone-specific $(γ, κ)$ tuning and +1.9% to +16.0% for DualSpectralCF-Cheby at the fixed default $(γ= -0.5, κ= 0.1)$, and the family runs 7.7 to 155.3$\times$ faster than SIGformer while reaching 70.7% to 90.7% of its accuracy. Sign-awareness helps most for cold-start users, with up to +29.2% Recall@20 on Epinions users with 1 to 5 training items.
