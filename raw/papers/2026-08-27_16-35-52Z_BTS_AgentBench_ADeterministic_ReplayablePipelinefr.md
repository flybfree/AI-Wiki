# BTS-AgentBench: A Deterministic, Replayable Pipeline from Read-Only Telemetry Logs to Agent Benchmarks

## Abstract
Industrial sites contain large volumes of read-only telemetry, but few benchmarks specify how to compile these records into executable multi-turn agent tasks. We present a telemetry-to-episode construction method instantiated as BTS-AgentBench. The pipeline normalizes BTS metadata and raw histories into a read-only tool store, compiles static tasks with tool-derived gold answers and evidence, and lifts retained tasks into typed, bounded operator-facing episodes. The 532-row release adds clarification, goal revision, timestamp policy, quality-gated reporting, and evidence attribution while preserving the source computation and split. Coded contract preflight reports zero findings, and the construction-exclusion controller completes 0/532 rows. Two independent raw-to-episode builds match all 11 logical tool-store exports and reproduce the released 356/87/89 train/dev/test artifact exactly. Applying the shared construction path to XAI4HEAT produces 204 episodes; on its 41-row held-out test split, the controller completes 0 rows and the retained GPT-5.5 execution completes all 41. Code, artifacts, and replay reports are available at https://github.com/kjy7567/BTS-AgentBench.
