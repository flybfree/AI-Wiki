# PN-QNN: Harnessing Physical Noise as a Native Regularizer in Photonic Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks

## Abstract
Physical noise in near-term quantum hardware is usually treated as a nuisance to suppress. We ask whether it can instead act as a hardware-native regularizer for photonic hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (PHQCNNs), analogous to noise-injection regularization in classical deep learning. Using Quandela's Perceval simulator and the MerLin framework, we build PHQCNNs for Iris, Digits, and MNIST and inject Perceval's seven-parameter physical noise model directly into training. A genetic algorithm searches the six continuous noise dimensions and 1 boolean parameter to find, per dataset, the configuration maximizing validation accuracy, compared against a noiseless baseline across five seeds. GA-tuned noise yields modest accuracy gains on Iris (+0.82pp) and Digits (+1.45pp), but a clear degradation on MNIST (-1.21pp). Per-parameter sweeps show that no individual noise parameter is consistently beneficial, motivating the joint search, while a second-order loss expansion shows that physical noise induces a Tikhonov-like regularization term whose effect is dataset-dependent. Physical photonic noise can thus act as a free regularizer, but not universally.
