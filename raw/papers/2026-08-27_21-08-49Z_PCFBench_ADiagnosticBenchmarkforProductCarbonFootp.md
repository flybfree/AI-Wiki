# PCFBench: A Diagnostic Benchmark for Product Carbon Footprint Estimation

## Abstract
AI systems are being deployed on high-stakes, domain-specific workflows that demand correctness not just in the final output, but at every intermediate step. One such workflow is estimating a product carbon footprint (PCF), the greenhouse-gas emissions attributable to a physical product. AI agents are increasingly being used to generate PCFs, but existing evaluations score either total emissions (hiding error sources and cancelling mistakes) or sub-tasks in isolation (missing compositional interactions). We introduce PCFBench, the first benchmark to carve PCF modeling into independently-evaluable tasks that require decomposition, retrieval, ontology matching, and numerical extraction. It comprises 614 expert-labelled items across six tasks. Together they probe reasoning under under-specification, conflicting context, and numerical constraints. Across eight frontier LLMs from four providers, no single model dominates. Although the strongest models estimate total product emissions within 2 times of declared totals on 77% of products, this rate drops to 37-58% when the PCF is generated step by step, with only 45-75% obeying mass conservation. These failures undermine the transparency practitioners need to compare products and drive decarbonization. We release the dataset and evaluation harness to support targeted progress.
