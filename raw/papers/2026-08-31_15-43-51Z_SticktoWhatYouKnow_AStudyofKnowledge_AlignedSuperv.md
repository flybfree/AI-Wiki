# Stick to What You Know: A Study of Knowledge-Aligned Supervised Fine-Tuning

## Abstract
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) trains a base language model to imitate target responses, and these targets may require knowledge the base model has not robustly internalized. We study this as a source of hallucinations and frame a group of mitigation methods as \emph{knowledge-aligned SFT}: constraining SFT training targets to the base model's parametric knowledge. Under a unified setup, we compare existing generation-based and estimation-based knowledge-alignment methods and introduce two new variants: Evidence Rewrite, which verifies base-model generations using external evidence, and Recall Rewrite, which retains claims only when they can be consistently recalled by the base model. Experiments with Qwen 3 4B and OLMo 3 7B show that knowledge-aligned SFT can reduce factual hallucinations on WildHalu and Biography while largely preserving general capabilities. Recall Rewrite yields the strongest factuality gains and improves refusal behavior on UnknownBench. It thereby confirms that SFT targets beyond the base model's knowledge drive hallucination behavior.
