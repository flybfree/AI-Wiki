# Listen, Reason, and Segment: Aligning LALMs with Editorial Judgment for Media Chapterization

## Abstract
Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have made rapid progress on standardized benchmarks, yet their deployment in practical media workflows, curation, archival indexing, and content distribution remains largely unrealized. We identify automated audio chapterization, the task of segmenting continuous audio streams into thematically coherent chapters, as a demanding and commercially consequential setting that exposes this gap. Chapterization is challenging because boundaries are defined less by objective acoustic events than by subjective editorial judgment, requiring models to reason sequentially over long acoustic contexts and approximate creator-authored boundary decisions. We present AudioChaps, a post-training framework for aligning end-to-end LALMs for this task via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To support training and evaluation, we curate three datasets: AudioChaps-Alignment, derived from creator-annotated chapter boundaries on YouTube; AudioChaps-CoT, which provides structured supervision for well-formatted, high-quality, and evidence-grounded boundary reasoning; and AudioChaps-Eval, a held-out benchmark for audio chapterization. Applying GRPO directly without a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) cold start, AudioChaps-R1-Zero already improves average F1 by 33 points over the state-of-the-art LALM Audio-Flamingo-3-Think. The AudioChaps framework produces our final aligned LALM, AudioChaps-R1, which improves average F1 by 49 points. These results demonstrate that GRPO-trained LALMs can reliably transform unstructured auditory streams into navigable, structured media. Our code, models, and dataset resources will be released upon acceptance at https://github.com/ta012/AudioChaps.
