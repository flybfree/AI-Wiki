# UniPolymer: A Unified Framework for Property Prediction, Structure Recommendation, and Evaluation in Polyimide Design

## Abstract
Designing polyimide structures with specific glass transition temperatures (Tg) is highly challenging. Existing methods primarily focus on target-conditioned generation, lacking an assessment of the consistency between the generated structure and the target properties. This leads to low-quality candidates deviating from the design objective entering subsequent processes, increasing invalid experiments and prolonging the development cycle. To address this issue, we propose UniPolymer, a unified framework for property prediction, target-conditioned generation, candidate evaluation, and structure recommendation in polyimide design and a dataset containing 10066 deduplicated polyimide repeating units with Tg tags (PITg-Curated) was constructed. To improve the consistency between generated candidate structures and the target Tg, UniPolymer first establishes a reliable structure-property relationship mapping through self-supervised chemical semantic learning, structural consistency enhancement, and multi-scale information fusion. Subsequently, the model employs a continuous-discrete joint Tg representation to guide the autoregressive generation of SELFIES. The generated candidate structures are further evaluated using a frozen property predictor and polyimide-specific structural constraints, and ranked according to their deviation from the target Tg, thereby preventing structures deviating from the target from entering the subsequent validation stage. Experimental results show that UniPolymer achieved a property prediction accuracy of R^2=0.93 and a candidate structure evaluation pass rate of 73.79%, which are 2% and 1.21% higher than the best baseline, respectively. Meanwhile, the predicted Tg values of the recommended candidates are in high agreement with the results of molecular dynamics simulations, thereby reducing the number of candidates that enter the high-cost experimental stage.
