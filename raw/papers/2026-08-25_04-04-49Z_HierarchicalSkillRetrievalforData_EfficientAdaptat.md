# Hierarchical Skill Retrieval for Data-Efficient Adaptation of Vision-Language-Action Models

## Abstract
While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pretrained on large-scale robot datasets provide a strong foundation for robot manipulation, their performance can degrade when adapted to new tasks with limited task-specific demonstrations. Retrieval offers a practical way to reuse existing demonstrations for data-efficient adaptation, but existing methods often rely on visual similarity, state-action representations, or task-level language matching. These approaches may overlook the hierarchical structure of long-horizon manipulation tasks, where complete task matches are rare but reusable skills are often abundant. To address this challenge, we propose Hierarchical Skill Retrieval (HSR), a retrieval framework for data-efficient VLA adaptation. Specifically, HSR first decomposes a target task into candidate skill sequences. It evaluates each plan based on both semantic plausibility and skill reliability estimated from the prior dataset. The selected decomposition is then used for hybrid retrieval. This combines subtask-level language retrieval with behavior-feature reranking to identify demonstrations that are both semantically relevant and compatible with the target task. Finally, we adapt the policy through a two-stage pretraining and finetuning pipeline, which separates general skill acquisition from task-specific adaptation. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and several real-world robot manipulation tasks show that HSR improves the average success rate by 10.3% and 21.3% over the strongest baseline, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of structured skill-level retrieval for data-efficient VLA adaptation. Videos and code are available at https://hoar012.github.io/HSR-Project.
