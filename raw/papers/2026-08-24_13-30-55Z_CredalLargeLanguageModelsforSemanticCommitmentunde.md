# Credal Large Language Models for Semantic Commitment under Uncertainty

## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent but incorrect answers with unwarranted confidence. A central limitation is that standard LLMs represent uncertainty through a single predictive distribution, conflating epistemic ignorance with genuine ambiguity. We introduce Credal Large Language Models (CLLMs): an ensemble of LoRA adapters induces a credal set whose lower and upper probabilities expose the spread of plausible predictive distributions rather than collapsing to a single softmax output. From this representation we derive two complementary commitment scores. Credal Token Commitment (CTC) is a token-space score that combines lower-bound support, credal width, and intersection entropy, computed without additional generation. Semantic Commitment Consistency (SCC) extends commitment to semantic space using sampled completions, with SCC-Gap measuring the mismatch between token-level and semantic-level support. We evaluate hallucination detection, calibration, selective prediction, and reasoning on Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B across OpenBookQA, CoQA, TriviaQA, and ARC-Challenge. CLLM is the best method on QA accuracy at competitive expected calibration error, and CTC tracks the best hallucination AUROC within 1.5 pp on most settings without additional generation. On selective prediction at 80% coverage, CLLM with SCC reaches 99.0% accuracy on OpenBookQA, and on ARC-Challenge CLLM with Csem confidence achieves <= 0.6% ECE across the three backbones.
