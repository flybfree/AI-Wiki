# GVR-Coder: A Visual-Feedback Framework for Structured SVG Generation in Complex Document and Meeting Scenarios

## Abstract
In demanding professional environments and meeting review scenarios, lengthy text often imposes a high cognitive load. To facilitate efficient information communication, transforming verbose text into logically clear diagrams is essential. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) provide an effective representation for this purpose due to their editability and resolution independence. However, current research on Text-to-SVG generation remains hindered by three major challenges: (1) the scarcity of datasets for complex, logic-rich diagrams; (2) the absence of explicit layout priors, which leads to chaotic spatial arrangements; and (3) the lack of fine-grained visual feedback to validate rendered outputs and correct aesthetic defects. To address these challenges, at the data level, we introduce DocMeetSVG-100K, a large-scale SVG dataset tailored for document authoring and meeting review scenarios. At the model level, we propose GVR-Coder, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality logical diagrams from lengthy professional texts. Specifically, we adopt a curriculum-driven rejection sampling fine-tuning to progressively enhance the model's capability in modeling complex structures, while explicitly incorporating layout constraint knowledge during training. In addition, we introduce reinforcement learning from dual rendering feedback, a mechanism that provides implicit feedback through reward signals to jointly optimize structural complexity and visual aesthetics. Furthermore, we design a generate-verify-repair agent loop, which improves generation quality through explicit, fine-grained feedback and targeted refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVR-Coder outperforms competitive baselines and reliably produces logically coherent and visually appealing diagrams.
