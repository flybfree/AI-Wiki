# User-Centric Modeling of Transactional Sequences with Explainable State Space Models

## Abstract
We propose a hybrid approach for user-centric modeling of transactional event sequences that combines contrastive representation learning (CoLES) with State Space Models (SSMs). While contrastive methods yield high-quality compressed user representations, existing encoders -- RNNs and Transformers -- suffer from vanishing gradients or quadratic complexity, respectively. Mamba, a selective SSM, efficiently handles long-range dependencies but remains underexplored for personalized user analysis. We investigate two integration strategies: (1)~initializing the Mamba hidden state with a CoLES embedding, and (2)~prepending the projected CoLES embedding as a prefix token to the input sequence. Both approaches supply the model with an informative user prior from the first step. Experiments on three public datasets -- Age (multiclass age-group prediction), MBD (multi-label product acquisition), and Taobao (binary purchase prediction) -- demonstrate consistent improvements over standalone Mamba and CoLES with a linear classifier, with the hybrid models converging 2--3$\times$ faster than the plain SSM baseline. Explainability analysis via discretization-step maps and Integrated Gradients reveals selective event filtering on behavior-rich datasets and identifies the most informative transaction features.
