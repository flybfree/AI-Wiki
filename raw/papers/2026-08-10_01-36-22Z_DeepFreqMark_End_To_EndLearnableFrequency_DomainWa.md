# DeepFreqMark: End-To-End Learnable Frequency-Domain Watermarking with Spherical Attack Simulation for Latent Diffusion Models

## Abstract
The proliferation of AI-generated images produced by Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) has raised critical concerns regarding copyright infringement and misinformation. Although existing frequency-domain watermarking methods embed handcrafted geometric patterns into the initial latent noise prior to generation, they suffer from limited capacity and rigid pattern designs. We propose DeepFreqMark, an end-to-end learnable frequency-domain watermarking framework that replaces manual pattern engineering with a neural message encoder and decoder. To circumvent the computational bottleneck caused by Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) inversion during training, we introduce a Spherical Linear Interpolation (Slerp)-based attack simulation. This approach operates directly on the noise latent while strictly preserving the Gaussian variance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeepFreqMark achieves significantly lower Bit Error Rates (BER) than baseline methods under real-world attacks and scales to 256 bits message capacity. Our source code is available at https://github.com/chenhsiu48/DeepFreqMark.
