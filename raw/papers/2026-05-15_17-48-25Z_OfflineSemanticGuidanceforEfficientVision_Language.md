## Abstract
Billion-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies have recently shown impressive performance in robotic manipulation, yet their size and inference cost remain major obstacles for real-time closed-loop control. We introduce \textbf{VLA-AD}, a distillation framework that uses a Vision-Language Model as an offline semantic supervisor to transfer large VLA teachers into lightweight student policies. Instead of relying only on low-level action imitation, VLA-AD augments teacher-provided 7-DoF action targets with high-level semantic guidance, including task phase anchors and multi-frame operating-direction descriptions. These auxiliary signals are used only during training: at test time, the student policy runs independently, with neither the VLA teacher nor the VLM required. We evaluate VLA-AD on three LIBERO benchmark suites. Using OpenVLA-7B as the teacher, our method produces a 158M-parameter student, yielding a $44\times$ reduction in model size while matching the teacher with only a $0.27\%$ average relative gap. The resulting policy runs at 12.5 Hz on an RTX 4090, achieving a $3.28\times$ inference speedup over OpenVLA-7B. We further show that the same semantic distillation pipeline generalizes to a different $π_{0.5}$-4B teacher, where the student outperforms the teacher on two suites and remains within $0.53\%$ on \texttt{libero\_goal}. Additional analysis indicates that phase-level supervision and multi-frame directional cues make the student less sensitive to noisy teacher actions, such as erroneous high-frequency gripper changes. Overall, VLA-AD demonstrates that offline semantic guidance from VLMs can substantially improve the efficiency, robustness, and deployability of VLA policy distillation.
