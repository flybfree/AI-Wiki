# RESPClinBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Clinical Decision-Making and Longitudinal Disease Management in Respiratory Specialty Care

## Abstract
Background: Respiratory specialty care requires multimodal interpretation, longitudinal risk assessment, guideline-concordant intervention, and whole-course management, which are poorly represented by examination-oriented medical benchmarks. Objective: To develop RESPClinBench, a real-world scenario-based benchmark for respiratory clinical decision-making, and evaluate seven contemporary large language models across AECOPD-PIM and PNBIM. Methods: RESPClinBench cases were adapted from de-identified respiratory clinical data. Three attending-level respiratory physicians revised cases, reference answers, and atomic clinical-action points, while one senior respiratory specialist performed cross-review and final adjudication. AECOPD-PIM comprised 427 open-ended COPD cases, and PNBIM comprised 196 multimodal pulmonary nodule cases combining chest CT with structured clinical information. Seven models generated 4,361 responses through standardized API inference with temperature 0 and a maximum output length of 8192 tokens. An automated framework calculated the final score as the arithmetic mean of atomic-action recall and rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge assessment. Results: Across 623 cases, the mean final score was 68.58. Qwen3.6-27B ranked first overall at 71.22, Qwen3.5-397B-A17B led PNBIM at 72.48, and Qwen3.6-27B led AECOPD-PIM at 71.11. Imaging hallucination and serious medical risk occurred in 31.85% and 8.16% of PNBIM responses; medication-safety risk and serious medical risk occurred in 26.93% and 1.44% of AECOPD-PIM responses. Conclusions: RESPClinBench identifies task-specific limitations in multimodal pulmonary nodule assessment and longitudinal COPD management. Combining explicit clinical-action coverage, holistic evaluation, and independent safety flags provides a clinically grounded basis for model selection and prospective validation.
