# Curate Before You Connect: Identity and Ontology Tagging in a Production Knowledge Graph

## Abstract
Extraction produces candidate entities and relationships; writing them into a graph is where identity is decided, and identity decisions are destructive in a way extraction errors are not. A wrong type can be corrected later, but two records merged under one identity cannot be separated once their properties have been combined, and the merge leaves no error behind. This paper describes the ingestion and ontology-tagging layer that turns a validated extraction stream into a knowledge graph of 537,157 entities and 2,198,567 relationships drawn from 98,795 government documents. We describe a record-identity ladder that decides sameness from identifier columns, name columns, display names and type-scoped position rather than from name similarity. The ladder governs de-duplication within parsed tables, while the graph write applies a coarser canonical-name key, so records sharing a canonical name merge automatically on exact equality. We argue rather than demonstrate that this is where the automation line belongs: no identity benchmark is reported, and the over-merges the key permits are undetectable by construction. That policy, under which entity resolution only ever flags candidates, followed an incident in which two surface forms of one name were merged, corrupting a correct record and deleting eight entities from an unrelated document. We then describe multi-class ontology tagging and an evidence asymmetry we did not anticipate: an entity name is an instance label rather than a type assertion, so matching name fragments against a class index invents classifications. Requiring anchored evidence cut role assignments on an enriched sample from 36 to 4, all confirmed correct. We quantify the graph's conformance debt, show secondary classifications compensating for a mis-parented primary class, and describe a curation queue grown to 48,403 pending proposals against 775 human decisions.
