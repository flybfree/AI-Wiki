# Scrouting: Cost-Aware Routing of Coding Agents by Scouting the Repository First

## Abstract
Frontier language models can resolve repository-level software issues, but each attempt is expensive, and existing routers select a model from the issue text alone. We present SuperScout, which routes after scouting the repository: a 7B searcher, SuperScout-7B, first explores the repository and produces a structured handoff whose reproduction claims are sandbox-verified, with false claims stripped before delivery. The searcher's hidden states, together with the task text, then feed a resume-based router that dispatches the task to one of four frontier fixers. Adding a new fixer requires no retraining. On the full Python slice of SWE-bench Pro (266 tasks) under the benchmark's official capped budget tier, SuperScout matches the best single model's solve rate (159 of 266 for SuperScout, 158 for the best model) at about a fifth of the total cost per solve, and the reported configuration sits above the random traffic-splitting baseline. A no-router ablation, always the cheapest fixer with the handoff, ties the routed system on this benchmark, so the handoff rather than the routing decision carries the result. A paired calibration study points to the mechanism: the handoff appears to redistribute rather than add solving ability, lifting the three cheaper fixers while slightly hurting the strongest, though at $N=99$ the per-fixer effects are directional only; the searcher's hidden states improve cost routing on the calibration labels while the handoff's own text does not. The searcher's compute adds less than half a cent of GPU time per task.
