# OmniVerifier-M1: Multimodal Meta-Verifier with Explicit Structured Recalibration

## Abstract
Visual outcomes are increasingly central to multimodal large language models, making reliable and fine-grained verification essential for scaling generalist foundation models. In this work, we investigate multimodal meta-verification, which leverages verifier-generated rationales rather than decision-only signals, and explore how to effectively incorporate meta-verification feedback into multimodal verifier training. We identify two key findings. First, symbolic verifier outputs (e.g., bounding boxes) outperform textual explanations as meta-verification rationales, enabling efficient rule-based reinforcement learning rewards while avoiding reliance on model-based rewards from auxiliary judge models. Second, decoupling reinforcement learning objectives for binary judgment and meta-verification substantially outperforms joint reward optimization, due to intrinsic differences in output structure and learning dynamics. Based on these insights, we train OmniVerifier-M1, a generalist visual verifier leveraging symbolic meta-verification and decoupled reinforcement learning. OmniVerifier-M1 provides robust verification and fine-grained error localization, and further enables M1-TTS, a verifier-driven agentic generation system achieving dynamic region-level self-correction. This approach paves the way for more reliable, interpretable, and fine-grained multimodal verification, supporting safer and more controllable foundation model deployment.
