# Soft Redaction of Image Provenance via Zero-Knowledge Proofs

## Abstract
Content provenance standards, such as C2PA, are increasingly used to attach signed records of origin, editing history, and rights to digital images. However, provenance transparency can conflict with privacy -- assertions that strengthen trust in an image may also reveal sensitive information about the creator or capture context. We propose soft redaction for image provenance: a mechanism that replaces sensitive provenance assertions with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) of selected properties over hidden data. Our work focuses on distance proofs. We first show how location assertions can support proofs of proximity to a public reference point, using Chebyshev polynomial approximations within the ZKP proof circuit. We then extend the approach to L2 distance proofs over biometric embeddings, enabling privacy-preserving claims related to likeness to help enforce personality rights with images. Finally, we apply the same distance-proof construction to perceptual hashes (visual fingerprints), supporting an anti-spoofing use case in watermark-based recovery of stripped provenance metadata. Our results demonstrate that ZKPs over image provenance can provide practical soft-redaction capabilities, compatible with C2PA, that may be constructed in seconds and verified in milliseconds.
