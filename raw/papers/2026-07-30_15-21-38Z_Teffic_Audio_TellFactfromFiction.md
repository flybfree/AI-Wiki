# Teffic-Audio: Tell Fact from Fiction

## Abstract
Speech deepfake detection has expanded in scope with increasingly heterogeneous spoofing mechanisms, including speech synthesis, voice conversion, vocoder reconstruction, and neural-codec resynthesis. The resulting spoofing artifacts can be further shaped by variability in source speech, recording environments, and transmission channels. This variability makes robust generalization across heterogeneous conditions a central requirement for practical detection systems. This report presents Teffic-Audio, a general speech deepfake detection system designed for comprehensive evaluation environment. Teffic-Audio adopts a straightforward detector architecture consisting of a Conformer-based speech encoder, multi-head attentive statistics pooling, and a binary classifier. Rather than relying on additional architectural complexity, the system improves generalization through its training recipe, which integrates multi-source data, attack- and source-balanced sampling, and diverse audio augmentation. Trained only with open-source data, Teffic-Audio achieves a pooled EER of 1.454% on the 14 test sets of Speech-DF-Arena, outperforming all currently public systems on the leaderboard. It also obtains the lowest EER on five individual test sets and shows a favorable performance-complexity trade-off compared with larger leading systems. Overall, Teffic-Audio provides a strong and practical reference system for general speech deepfake detection.
