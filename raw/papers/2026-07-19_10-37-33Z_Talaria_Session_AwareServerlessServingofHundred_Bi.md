# Talaria: Session-Aware Serverless Serving of Hundred-Billion-Parameter LLMs

## Abstract
Serverless multi-model LLM systems multiplex popularity-skewed model catalogs over shared GPU pools, yet typically schedule each request independently. Tool-using agents break this abstraction: a session repeatedly calls an LLM across short tool gaps, carries a long reusable KV prefix, and is judged by session completion time (SCT). Load-only routing can separate a continuation from both its model and KV state, while round-based model multiplexing can delay even a correctly placed continuation until the target model's next slot. Both failures are especially costly for hundred-billion-parameter models: their weights constrain residency, while long-context KV is expensive to reconstruct or move.   We present Talaria, a session-aware serverless multi-model serving system that makes session continuity a joint placement-and-admission decision. Its router ranks placements by model residency, KV locality, and instance pressure, while soft reservations account for likely returns in the last serving instance's admission budget. Session-prefill (SP) admits budget-eligible continuations before the active model slot closes. An instance-local substrate keeps HBM addresses stable, preserves host-restorable KV, and stages weights across model switches.   On a single TP=8 server, we replay 30 SWE-Bench model-sessions (960 calls) over three models, each with more than 100B total parameters. Against an otherwise identical round scheduler with SP, host-KV restoration, and D2D staging disabled, Talaria cuts p50 SCT from 1000 s to 189 s and p95 from 2296 s to 867 s, speedups of 5.3x and 2.6x.
