# CosMAP: Contrastive Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimensionality Reduction of Omics and Genealogical Data

## Abstract
Omics datasets, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing data, are high-dimensional, sparse, noisy, and dominated by zero values, making faithful low-dimensional representation challenging. Existing dimensionality-reduction methods may distort local neighbourhoods, global organization, or the cohesion of meaningful populations, with similar limitations arising in genealogical data. We introduce Contrastive Manifold Approximation and Projection (CosMAP), a graph-based unsupervised dimensionality-reduction method for producing faithful and interpretable embeddings. CosMAP extends the graph-based framework of UMAP by combining cosine-similarity neighbourhoods with temperature-normalized contrastive affinities, which are optimized in the embedding space using an attractive--repulsive objective. It further employs a two-phase refinement strategy: an intermediate higher-dimensional representation is first learned and then used to reconstruct the neighbourhood graph and initialize the final low-dimensional embedding. We evaluate CosMAP on MNIST and USPS handwritten-digit datasets, mouse retina and cortex single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, and a large genealogical kinship dataset derived from BALSAC-CARTaGENE. Compared with state-of-the-art dimensionality-reduction methods, CosMAP produces more coherent visual representations, improves neighbourhood preservation, and provides clearer global organization of digit classes, biological cell populations, and regional genealogical patterns. These results indicate that CosMAP offers a robust framework for exploratory analysis of complex, sparse, high-dimensional data. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/FenosoaRandrianjatovo/CosMAP-dr.
