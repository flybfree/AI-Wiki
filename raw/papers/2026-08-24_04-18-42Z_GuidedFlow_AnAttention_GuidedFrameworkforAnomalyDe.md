# GuidedFlow: An Attention-Guided Framework for Anomaly Detection in Additive Manufacturing

## Abstract
Additive Manufacturing (AM) plays a vital role in the ongoing industrial revolution. However, quality control remains crucial and challenging due to printing defects or potential cyber-physical intrusions. Image or video-based anomaly detection is a key effort towards addressing these challenges. Various approaches have been explored in this domain, including reconstruction-based, embedding-based, and flow-based methods. Though normalizing flow-based methods address some of the core challenges of unforeseen defects and generalization while maintaining detection performance, existing approaches struggle with tiny/stringing defects common in 3D printing. In a small-data setting, this poses a limitation in generalization. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{GuidedFlow}, a novel attention-guided normalizing flow model for anomaly detection and localization. GuidedFlow employs a pre-trained ResNet model, fine-tuned on the domain dataset. An attention-guided spatial and temporal flow framework models the dynamics across multiple scales and frames. A Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (SAN) enables the flow model to prioritize relevant contextual cues from input frames. We evaluate GuidedFlow on our AM3D-AD dataset, consisting of benign and anomalous real 3D printed object images and videos. We also conduct a comparative study using the MVTec-AD industrial image anomaly detection dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GuidedFlow outperforms most of the state-of-the-art models with enhanced detection accuracy and AUROC.
