# ESRVS: Extreme Semi-Supervised Retinal Vessel Segmentation with a Single Annotated Image

## Abstract
Learning from minimal human supervision is a long-standing goal in medical image analysis, where dense expert annotations are costly. We study retinal vessel segmentation in an extreme semi-supervised setting with one annotated image and a pool of unlabeled images. We propose ESRVS, which selects a representative reference image for manual annotation and transfers vessel cues using target-domain-adapted DINOv3 features. ESRVS constructs a multi granular vessel prototype, combines prototype-similarity maps with a physics-inspired prior to generate initial pseudo-labels, and refines the transferred supervision through weighted pseudo-label training and adversarial refinement. Across eight public datasets, ESRVS achieves the best Dice and clDice on six datasets, and the best HD95 on all eight datasets among the compared semi-supervised methods, although those methods use 10 to 20% labeled data. With Mask2Former, ESRVS retains on average 93.7% of fully supervised Dice and 95.1% of fully supervised clDice. These results demonstrate the potential of foundation-model label propagation for highly label-efficient retinal vessel segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/IAANNH/ESRVS.
