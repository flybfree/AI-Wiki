# Hallucination Mitigation for Large Vision-Language Models via Implicit Feature Stabilization

## Abstract
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are prone to hallucinations: they fluently describe objects, attributes, and scenes that are not in the image. We connect part of this failure to a measurable property of their representations, feature instability, where mild semantics-preserving perturbations of the input cause large changes in the learned embeddings; hallucination rates rise together with this variability. Existing stability-motivated remedies are explicit, in the sense that they intervene at inference time through latent steering or constrained decoding, and pay for it on every query. We propose implicit stabilization instead: perturbation-invariance is built into the model weights during fine-tuning, and nothing extra runs at deployment. Our framework, INFUSE, first stabilizes visual and textual representations around perturbation-averaged and ground-truth anchors, then aligns the stabilized representations across modalities with bidirectional contrastive objectives. We prove that the anchor's root-mean-square deviation from the perturbation-mean representation shrinks at rate $1/\sqrt{K}$ in the number of views, and that under a Lipschitz decoder, this bounds how much any perturbation can change the model's hallucination behavior. On LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-1.6, and Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct, INFUSE reduces AMBER CHAIR by 46-63% relative to each base model, improves ObjHal, MMHal, HallusionBench, and POPE, and preserves VQA-v2 and TextVQA, all with no inference-time overhead.
