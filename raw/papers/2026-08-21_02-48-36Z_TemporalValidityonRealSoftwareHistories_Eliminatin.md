# Temporal Validity on Real Software Histories: Eliminating Stale-Fact Errors in Code-Assistant Memory over GitHub Fixes

## Abstract
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has no model of time: when a fact changes across a coding session - a function is renamed, an endpoint moves, a dependency is bumped - RAG retrieves both the old and new value with near-identical similarity and cannot tell which is current, so it serves the superseded value. Paper 1 showed, on synthetic single-value benchmarks, that a deterministic (subject, relation, object) supersession memory eliminates this failure. Here we validate it end-to-end on real software history. From 707 real GitHub issues (SWE-bench Lite + Verified) we extract 130 clean atomic state transitions, a fix that changes one identifiable value from a pre-fix to a post-fix form, and render each marker-free (the stale and current statements differ only in the value). On this set, MemStrata reaches 0.91 answer accuracy versus RAG's 0.57-0.59; and, the structural result, when forced to answer RAG serves the superseded value 36-38% of the time (an LLM reranker does not help) while MemStrata drives this to ~0, at RAG retrieval latency (~2.1 s vs ~18 s for the reranker). We are explicit about scope: only ~18% of real fixes are clean atomic transitions; Paper 2 isolates the memory mechanism on that class, and extraction coverage of the remaining fixes is the orthogonal problem we defer to follow-on work. A real product bug surfaced and was fixed during the study (a case/punctuation-insensitive value comparison), with the moat property (deterministic-supersession accuracy on clean code mutations) preserved and verified.
