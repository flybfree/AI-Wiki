# Single-Beat Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation Using Ear-PPG and ECG with a Lightweight Hybrid Learning Framework

## Abstract
Continuous cuffless blood pressure (BP) monitoring remains challenging due to motion artifacts, physiological variability, and the limited robustness of conventional pulse transit time (PTT) models under dynamic conditions. Many prior approaches rely on multi-second windows to stabilize estimation, an assumption that is frequently violated during real-world monitoring with intermittent signal corruption. Here, we show that discriminative BP-related information is preserved at the single-beat level and present a lightweight multi-modal wearable framework for continuous BP estimation. The system integrates synchronized chest electrocardiography (ECG) and ear-clip reflectance photoplethysmography, each co-located with a 6-axis inertial measurement unit to provide motion context. We introduce a hybrid learning architecture in which a one-dimensional convolutional neural network extracts a 64-dimensional embedding from individual PPG beats and fuses it with 30 physiology-grounded features, including PTT statistics and heart rate variability, followed by LightGBM regression. The method was evaluated using a multi-phase stress protocol ($n=10$) and the PulseDB public dataset with subject-disjoint validation. Across 30 independent runs, the model achieved mean absolute errors of $4.02 \pm 0.21$~mmHg for systolic BP and $1.79 \pm 0.05$~mmHg for diastolic BP, corresponding to a 28.2\% reduction in combined MAE relative to baseline models. By enabling beat-wise estimation without long temporal context, this framework supports computationally efficient cuffless BP monitoring suitable for wearable deployment under practical resource constraints.
