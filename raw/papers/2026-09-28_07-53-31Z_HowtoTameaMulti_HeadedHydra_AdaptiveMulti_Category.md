# How to Tame a Multi-Headed Hydra? Adaptive Multi-Category Safety Steering for Large Language Models

## Abstract
As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly widespread, preventing unsafe responses to harmful prompts is essential for their safe deployment. Activation steering offers an approach to improving LLM safety by modifying internal activations during inference without updating model parameters. However, a single prompt can involve multiple harm categories, and steering toward safety in one category may leave harmful content from another unaddressed. Despite advances in adaptive steering, existing methods do not explicitly coordinate steering direction and strength when multiple harm categories co-occur within a single prompt. To address this problem, we propose CAM-Steer, a Category-Adaptive Multi-category Safety Steering framework. Specifically, it estimates the risk associated with each harm category by comparing the current hidden state with safe and unsafe prototypes. The estimated risks are then used to combine the safety directions for different harm categories into a single steering direction and to determine the strength of the intervention. Finally, it rotates the hidden state along the composed steering direction, with the rotation angle determined by the estimated risks, while preserving the hidden-state norm. Experiments across three LLM backbones and seven harm categories show that CAM-Steer outperforms the evaluated baselines in average defense success rate, including when categories co-occur. Further analyses support its component designs and informative risk scores, with negligible inference overhead.
