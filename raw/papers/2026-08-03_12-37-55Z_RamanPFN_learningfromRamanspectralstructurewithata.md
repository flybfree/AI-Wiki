# RamanPFN: learning from Raman spectral structure with a tabular foundation model

## Abstract
Raman spectroscopy enables non-destructive, label-free molecular characterization across materials science, biomedicine and process monitoring. Predictive Raman datasets often contain few labelled spectra and thousands of ordered wavenumbers, with informative variation within bands and across distant spectral regions. Latent-variable chemometrics accommodates collinear small-sample data but can obscure fine peak morphology, whereas deep spectral networks resolve this structure only after task-specific training. TabPFN avoids task-specific parameter fitting through pretrained in-context inference, but processes very wide inputs as feature-subsampled views that do not preserve joint visibility of related bands. We present RamanPFN, a spectral representation framework that encodes these dependencies before TabPFN inference. Global Compositional Unmixing constructs non-negative coordinates over the complete spectrum so that distant bands with shared latent variation occupy a common predictive axis. Local Vibrational Subspace Encoding represents contiguous wavenumber regions with multiple orthogonal modes that retain independent changes in peak shape, intensity and position. The representations are evaluated separately and combined at the prediction level. Evaluation covered 150 tasks from 74 public Raman datasets. RamanPFN reduced root-mean-square error by 19.6% on average across 129 regression targets relative to direct TabPFN inference and further reduced the remaining classification error by 9.0% across 21 classification tasks. These results establish explicit spectral representation as an effective interface between high-dimensional Raman measurements and reusable tabular inference.
