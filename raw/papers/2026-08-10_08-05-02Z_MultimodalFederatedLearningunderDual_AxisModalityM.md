# Multimodal Federated Learning under Dual-Axis Modality Missingness

## Abstract
Multimodal federated learning (FL) supports collaborative modeling in privacy-sensitive health-sensing and medical settings, but realistic deployments often exhibit dual-axis modality missingness: clients have different modality sets, and individual samples may contain only subsets of the modalities available locally. Existing methods typically address these two axes separately. We propose Flux, a multimodal federated learning framework built around two complementary components. First, modality-aware confidence tempering learns sample-specific confidence for each modality through mask-aware unimodal supervision and fuses the confidence estimates from observed modalities into a sample-adaptive temperature that adjusts predictive sharpness according to evidence quality and completeness. Second, gradient-decoupled private adaptation applies this temperature only to a client-private prediction pathway, while training the shared federated model with a standard, untempered objective. This enables sample-specific, client-local confidence adaptation without allowing confidence-dependent gradients to perturb shared representation learning. Across four multimodal datasets, Flux achieves the highest average macro-F1 on every dataset, outperforming the strongest dataset-specific baseline by 0.8~2.2 points and by 1.6 points on average. Additional analyses demonstrate favorable calibration, temperature sensitivity to both modality missingness and input corruption, and more stable shared optimization under private-only tempering.
