# FL-MAESTRO: Multi-Agent LLM Orchestration for Resource-Constrained Federated Learning

## Abstract
In Federated Learning (FL), the communication topology is a runtime variable rather than a fixed design choice, since links and edge devices drop in and out during training. Each round, the server must commit three coupled decisions, namely the communication topology, per-client resource allocation, and the aggregation rule for combining local updates. Recent agentic systems have begun bringing large language models (LLM) into FL, but the existing line of work either operates at setup time or handles a single runtime dimension such as client selection. We propose FL-MAESTRO, a multi-agent orchestrator that makes the joint runtime FL decision directly through three specialist LLM agents, one per decision dimension. A coordinator combines their analyses into a single decision, and a non-LLM feasibility check confirms it before the round executes. Because the orchestrator consumes the server's predicted-failure list, it withholds clients whose updates would never be aggregated, which removes the dominant source of wasted round energy in classical FL on volatile edge networks. Because client state is read as natural-text profiles, the same orchestrator extends to heterogeneous device classes without per-class energy models. On a non-IID CIFAR-10 benchmark, FL-MAESTRO matches the accuracy of the strongest energy-aware baseline while cutting wasted round energy from over a third to near zero. Code is available at https://github.com/denoslab/FL-MAESTRO.
