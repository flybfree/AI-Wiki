# Hardware Keystores for AI Agent Signing Workflows: A Zero-Trust MCP Enforcement Architecture

## Abstract
AI agents performing cryptographic operations (signing Git commits, authenticating API calls, issuing certificates) currently store private keys in software-accessible locations: plaintext files, environment variables, or container memory. Any process with sufficient read privileges can extract the raw key material. A recent production incident demonstrated the practical severity: private keys were exfiltrated from a widely deployed framework via email injection in under five minutes. We aim to enforce both key confidentiality and content-aware authorisation for key use. To that end, we replace software-resident keys with hardware-confined keys accessible through a vendor-neutral PKCS#11 interface. A hardware keystore (HSM, TPM, smart card) executes cryptographic operations on-device; the host receives only the result via opaque handles. Hardware confinement is the primary contribution; it is enabled by a surrounding five-layer Zero-Trust enforcement stack comprising session identity (SAGA), scope bounds (Smax), semantic validation (RAV), taint tracking, and the hardware execution boundary. We evaluate against 12 injection scenarios derived from AgentDojo's ImportantInstructionsAttack template (Debenedetti et al., arXiv:2406.13352). We run four LLM models; three follow injections in baseline mode (gpt-oss-120b, Qwen2.5-72B, DeepSeek-V4-Flash, n=192 combined). Baseline Attack Success Rate (ASR): 19.3% [14.3%, 25.4%]; protected ASR: 0% (Wilson 95% CI upper bound 2.0%). Zero false positives across four benign task scenarios.
