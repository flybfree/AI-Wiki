# Tools Are Not Islands: Set-Level Tool Retrieval for LLM Agents via Query-Conditioned Hyperedge Prediction

## Abstract
Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on invoking external tools to complete real-world tasks. Tool retrieval, which selects a small task-relevant subset from a library of thousands of tools before the agent acts, has therefore become a critical component of LLM agent pipelines. However, existing retrievers either score each tool in isolation or assemble the tool set sequentially, so the joint utility of a candidate set is never evaluated as a whole. In this paper, we propose HYSET, short for HYperedge-based SEt-level Tool retrieval. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate tool retrieval as query-conditioned hyperedge prediction on a tool co-invocation hypergraph, under which the tool set itself becomes the unit of scoring and most existing retrieval paradigms reduce to restricted instances; (ii) we capture size-dependent tool compatibility through cardinality-specific interactions; and (iii) we design HYSET as a pre-selection module requiring no modification to the downstream agent. Experiments on ToolBench demonstrate that HYSET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both tool retrieval performance and end-to-end task success. Beyond the in-domain setting, HYSET further supports zero-shot/few-shot transfer, generalizing to held-out tools/categories and unseen domains with minimal supervision.
