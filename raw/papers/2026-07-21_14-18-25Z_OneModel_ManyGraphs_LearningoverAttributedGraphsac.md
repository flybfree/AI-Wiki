# One Model, Many Graphs: Learning over Attributed Graphs across Heterogeneous Modalities with Vision-Language Models

## Abstract
Vision-language models (VLMs) provide a unified representation space for textual and visual information, yet their potential as general-purpose backbones for graph-structured data remains largely unexplored. In practice, attributed graphs exhibit substantial modality heterogeneity: some graphs contain only textual node attributes, others only visual attributes, while still others provide both. Existing graph learning approaches are typically designed for fixed modality schemas, requiring separate models for different settings and limiting scalability and cross-graph generalization. To bridge this gap, we present OMG-VLM (One Model, Many Graphs with Vision-Language Models), a unified framework for learning over attributed graphs across heterogeneous modality schemas. OMG-VLM leverages a pretrained VLM as a shared backbone and introduces structure-aware graph adapters that integrate neighborhood information while remaining compatible with the VLM's native embedding space. This design enables effective learning over text-attributed, image-attributed, and multi-attributed graphs within a single model. Extensive experiments across diverse domains show that OMG-VLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNN- and LLM-based baselines on attributed graph learning tasks such as node classification and link prediction, while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen graphs and varying modality schemas.
