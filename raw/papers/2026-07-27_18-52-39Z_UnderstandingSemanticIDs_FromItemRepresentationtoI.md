# Understanding Semantic IDs: From Item Representation to Item Selection in Generative Recommendation

## Abstract
Semantic IDs (SIDs) are now a central component of generative recommendation. Current SID-based systems assign three roles to the same token sequence. Shared prefixes are intended to organize related items, the complete SID identifies an individual item, and each generated token narrows the items that can still be returned. We systematically investigate SIDs from item encoding and SID construction to autoregressive generation and final recommendation. We examine how SID construction changes item representations and how those changes affect generation. Across three Amazon domains and eight SID constructions, SID neighborhoods recover only 32.2% of the encoder's ten nearest neighbors on average. Alternative item descriptions still retrieve the corresponding item first in 99.57% of controlled cases, yet change 38.4% of exact SIDs. These results show that SIDs retain broad organization but lose much of the encoder's fine local structure, while their exact tokens are not determined by item meaning alone. This loss becomes consequential during generation. After the final semantic token, TIGER retains only 29.9% of held-out targets that were plausible recommendations before SID filtering. Motivated by these findings, we propose Item-Supported Decoding (ISD), a lightweight inference-time method that allows a user-specific item ranking to support corresponding SID prefixes before beam search discards them. The same ranking then orders the generated items. ISD requires no additional parameters or retraining of the SID constructor or decoder. We empirically show that ISD improves NDCG@10 over the corresponding SID backbone in every evaluated setting, with relative gains of up to 31.2%. Our results show that SIDs provide useful coarse item organization, but their fine boundaries should not alone determine which items remain available during generation.
