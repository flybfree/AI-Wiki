# CUBICS: Situation-aware performance estimation for safety-relevant ML components

## Abstract
Machine learning (ML) is a key technology driving innovation today, but ensuring ML safety remains a major challenge for safety-related applications. A promising idea is to build proven-in-use arguments from field data, e.g. by running ML components (MLCs) in shadow mode or within safety envelopes so that their outputs can be monitored as 'safe probes' without affecting safety. These probes can then be used to build a statistical argument about field performance in a Bayesian way. However, many Bayesian field-data approaches in safety engineering model failures as a simple Bernoulli (or binomial) process with a single global failure probability and i.i.d. trials, which is rarely adequate for MLCs whose performance depends strongly on context. Statistical evidence is also about coverage of relevant situations, including edge cases, and building a single integrated statistical model for the entire system is usually not feasible. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CUBICS, a context-modular framework for per-component, situation-aware performance estimation of safety-relevant ML components. CUBICS partitions the operational design domain into situations and, for each safety-relevant component, defines a set of situation-specific assumptions and probabilistic guarantees that are represented and updated in a Bayesian manner using Subjective Logic (SL). By combining these guarantees with beliefs about how often each situation occurs, CUBICS derives an overall risk estimate for each component without requiring a monolithic system-level statistical model, and thus provides a building block for modular, field-data based safety assurance.
