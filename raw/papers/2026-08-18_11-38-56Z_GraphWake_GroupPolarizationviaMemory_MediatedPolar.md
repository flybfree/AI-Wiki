# GraphWake: Group Polarization via Memory-Mediated Polarization Cascade in LLM-Agent Communities

## Abstract
LLM-driven agents can autonomously exchange opinions on online platforms and form communities. Such agent-operated social platforms raise a new security concern: attackers may manipulate agents to induce group polarization. Existing methods manipulate agent prompts or construct echo chambers, both of which are difficult to realize in practice. We therefore formulate a new threat, Memory-Mediated Polarization Cascade, which uses agent memory as a persistence channel and public discussion as a propagation channel. This threat contains three stages. During exposure and memory retention, the attacker exposes a small set of target agents to arguments that reinforce their respective stated stances. The targets' memory systems then process and retain these arguments. During retrieval and reproduction, a shared stance-neutral discussion cues the targets to retrieve and reproduce their respective retained arguments. During iterative propagation, untreated agents influenced by the reproduced arguments restate and spread them. We instantiate this threat in GraphWake with three components: (i) stance-support argumentation knowledge graphs construct knowledge-based arguments; (ii) axiom-oriented triple selection distills them for reliable retention and reproduction; and (iii) stance-neutral memory cueing triggers concurrent retrieval and reproduction, initiating propagation. Experiments across multiple discussions and memory systems show that GraphWake substantially increases group polarization. These findings reveal a community-level polarization risk.
