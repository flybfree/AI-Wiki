# Learning to Unlearn: Machine Unlearning via Learning the Unlearning Behaviors

## Abstract
Various machine unlearning techniques have been developed in response to privacy legislation requirements, enabling individuals to exercise their legal right to have their data $D_f$ removed from a machine learning model. This process is typically accomplished via the use of an unlearning function denoted as $U$. Existing methods focus on designing an intricate $U$ to unlearn $D_f \subset D$ from a previous model $A(D)$, so that the unlearned model performs as closely as possible to the retrained model $A(D \setminus D_f)$. However, these methods often suffer from high computational costs when dealing with massive training data, as the complex structures of $U$ become a bottleneck even for models with fewer parameters.   Inspired by Learning to Optimize, we introduce the first learning-based model-agnostic approach, Learning-to-UnLearn (L2UL). Our core insight is to shift from manually designing $U$ to learning the unlearning behaviors from a distribution perspective, thereby acquiring a simple and efficient $U$ via learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy achieved by L2UL is comparable to that of retraining while exhibiting impressive efficiency, particularly in data-intensive scenarios. Furthermore, we validate the performance and scalability of our method on larger models ResNet.
