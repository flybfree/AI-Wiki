# Beyond the Bidirectional Promise: Re-evaluating the Robustness of Diffusion Language Models

## Abstract
Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a compelling alternative to autoregressive (AR) generation by enabling bidirectional context and iterative refinement. However, their reliability under natural input noise and adversarial attacks remains under-explored. To address this, we systematically evaluate DLM robustness and calibration against AR baselines, using two parameter-matched pairs (LLaDA-8B vs. LLaMA-3-8B and Dream-7B vs. Qwen2.5-7B) across 32 natural perturbation conditions, adversarial gradient probes, and mechanistic hidden-state analyses. This paired design effectively isolates architecture-intrinsic properties from weight-dependent behaviors. We find a nuanced robustness profile: while highly stochastic DLM loss landscapes naturally resist gradient-based adversarial suffixes, they provide no guaranteed defense against natural noise, proving that everyday robustness is weight-dependent rather than inherently architectural. Furthermore, DLMs exhibit systematic overconfidence, presenting a practical deployment hazard. Most crucially, mechanistic probing reveals that all models perfectly encode input corruption, isolating behavioral fragility entirely to a decoder routing failure. Consistent with this diagnosis, we show that surface-level prompt patching fails to improve over noisy baselines. Ultimately, DLM robustness cannot be patched on; it must be fundamentally integrated into the iterative decoding loop.
