# SuperNeuroMAT: An Efficient Matrix-based Simulator for Spiking Neural Networks

## Abstract
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising pathway to energy-efficient AI and brain-inspired computing. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by a lack of fast, accessible, and versatile simulation frameworks. In this paper, we introduce SuperNeuroMAT, an open-source, scalable, and highly efficient Python-based SNN simulator. We devise a novel matrix-based approach to model the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron dynamics and natively support dense and sparse execution modes. This enables fast simulation of approximately 10,000 neurons in dense mode and 100,000 neurons in sparse mode on standard laptops and desktops without requiring specialized hardware. We demonstrate that SuperNeuroMAT consistently outperforms four established SNN simulators---NEST, Brian2, BindsNET, and snnTorch---on two performance metrics (execution speed and peak resident memory) and across various network sizes and connection probabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate SuperNeuroMAT's applicability across a diverse set of problems. SuperNeuroMAT can efficiently handle conventional machine learning benchmarks such as the Digits and citation network datasets as well as neuromorphic event-based vision tasks such as N-CARS and ASL-DVS. Moreover, it can be extended beyond machine learning workloads and facilitate general-purpose workloads. We validated this by implementing the neuromorphic shortest path algorithm and two arithmetic primitives (addition and multiplication). SuperNeuroMAT can be installed via the Python Package Index (PyPI), thereby lowering the barrier to entry into the field of neuromorphic computing and accelerating the broader development of neuromorphic algorithms.
