# Physics-informed distribution of relaxation times estimation and latent-space condition monitoring of solid oxide fuel and electrolysis cells from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy

## Abstract
Estimating the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) fromelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an ill-posed inverse problem that is highly sensitive to regularisation choices. We propose a physics-informed convolutional autoencoder that estimates DRT directly from EIS data without spectrum-specific tuning. A discretised relation between impedance and the DRT is embedded in the training process, constraining the network to produce impedance-consistent distributions. The model resolves overlapping relaxation processes in synthetic two-ZARC spectra and accurately reconstructs measurements from three independent solid oxide fuel and electrolysis cell datasets, with range-normalised errors below 1.1%. Decoder-probe analysis shows that the learned latent representation is organised according to relaxation timescale. Distances in this latent space capture operating changes, hydrogen-shortage events, and long-term degradation. The same lightweight architecture is applied across all datasets without modification, providing consistent DRT estimation and an interpretable basis for condition monitoring.
