# PartMat: Material-Aware 3D Part Decomposition with a Single Global Latent

## Abstract
Part-level 3D generation has recently attracted increasing attention for producing structured and editable 3D assets. However, existing methods typically decompose objects according to functional semantics rather than the editable material boundaries (e.g., fabric, wood, metal) required in practical 3D applications such as interior design. Additionally, current methods often generate parts independently, causing computational costs to scale linearly with the part count. To address these limitations, we present PartMat, an efficient material-aware 3D part decomposition pipeline that represents multi-part geometry with a single global latent. Given a reference image and a single whole-object geometry, PartMat decomposes the object into parts that follow material boundaries. First, we propose PartVAE to learn such a unified representation and decode all material parts in a single forward pass, thereby decoupling inference cost from the number of parts. Second, with this representation, a diffusion model is trained for part generation and refined via reinforcement learning for accurate material assignment and overlap suppression. Finally, to recover fine-grained geometric details, we introduce a sparse-voxel flow-matching model with part attention for geometry post-processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PartMat significantly outperforms existing baselines in material-aware decomposition accuracy and achieves comparable geometric quality, while maintaining efficient inference.
