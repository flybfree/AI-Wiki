# Global Optimization and Inference-Time Region Grafting for Agentic Workflows

## Abstract
Recent advances in agentic workflow optimization automate workflow design through task-specific workflow search or input-conditioned architecture selection. However, they determine the workflow before execution and cannot adapt failed workflow regions using execution-time label-free quality signals. Naively enabling such inference-time adaptation through whole-workflow re-optimization would be computationally prohibitive. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GRAFT, which preserves a globally optimized workflow while locally replacing only selected regions for each input. Without parameter training, GRAFT evaluates region-level alternatives using label-free execution-quality signals and accepts only replacements that improve local quality while preserving workflow-level consistency, thereby enabling instance-wise adaptation without whole-workflow re-optimization. GRAFT applies without modification across a range of tasks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and multi-hop and knowledge-intensive question answering. Under matched optimizer and executor settings, it improves over the strongest prior workflow-optimization method, MaAS, by 3.85 points on average. Replacing only the executor with a stronger model yields further gains without re-optimizing the global workflow. This suggests that an optimized workflow is not merely a static optimization artifact, but an adaptable execution policy that can evolve with inference-time feedback and stronger executors.
