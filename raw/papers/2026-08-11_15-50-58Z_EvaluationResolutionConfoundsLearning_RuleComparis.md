# Evaluation Resolution Confounds Learning-Rule Comparisons in Model-Brain RSA of Early Visual Cortex

## Abstract
Representational similarity analysis (RSA) is increasingly used to ask which learning rules give convolutional networks brain-like representations. Because biologically plausible rules such as feedback alignment, predictive coding and STDP do not scale, studies that include them train small networks on small images (typically 32x32 CIFAR) and then compare them to brain responses modeled at much higher resolution. We find that a common result in this setting, that untrained or locally trained networks rival or beat backpropagation at early visual cortex, depends strongly on the resolution at which the network is evaluated. The V1 gap between an untrained network and a backpropagation-trained one widens from -0.001 +/- 0.007 at the 32px training resolution to +0.044 +/- 0.006 at 224px, growing monotonically across six resolutions (n=5 seeds). It holds in human fMRI and, directionally, in single-seed macaque electrophysiology, along the training trajectory, and for an ImageNet ResNet-50 and a Swin-Tiny transformer trained at 224px. Four candidate mechanisms are tested and none accounts for it: train/eval resolution matching, low-level Gabor and pixel structure, the normalization state of the untrained baseline, and convergence of the pooled descriptor toward a global brightness statistic; three are excluded by interventions holding the convolutional weights bit-identical. A fifth experiment locates the effect: capping image detail at the training resolution while letting the pooled positions grow 12-fold removes about 90% of it, so the dependence is carried by image detail rather than by pooling. Separately, a single scalar luminance value per image reaches rho = 0.075 against the V1 RDM, essentially matching the untrained network's 0.076, which bounds what this style of comparison can resolve. The one learning effect that holds across resolution is backprop above untrained, at LOC.
