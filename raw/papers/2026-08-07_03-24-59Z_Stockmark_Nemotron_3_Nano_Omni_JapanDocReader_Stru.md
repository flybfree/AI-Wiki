# Stockmark-Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni-JapanDocReader: Structured Document Parsing via Capability Injection and Forgetting Control

## Abstract
We present Stockmark-Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni-JapanDocReader, a Japanese document understanding model built from Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni-30B-A3B-Reasoning-BF16. The central goal of this work is structured document parsing via capability injection and forgetting control: we inject Japanese structured document parsing capability into a reasoning-oriented multimodal model while preserving its document VQA capability as much as possible. We study parsing-centric SFT, which uses only structured document parsing data; mixed SFT, which combines structured document parsing and VQA data; and parsing-centric RL, which optimizes structured parsing with a task-level reward. Our experiments show that parsing-centric SFT substantially improves structured document parsing performance but causes measurable VQA forgetting. Mixed SFT mitigates this forgetting while preserving nearly the same structured parsing performance. Applying DAPO-based parsing-centric RL on top of the mixed SFT checkpoint further improves structured document parsing beyond the SFT ceiling, producing the final released model. The training data is constructed with a data engine consisting of two complementary synthetic streams: a Japanese Document VQA Stream and a programmatic structured document parsing stream. We also discuss reward design and variance-based prompt filtering for continuous structured document parsing rewards, highlighting their importance for making RL effective in long-reasoning structured document parsing tasks.
