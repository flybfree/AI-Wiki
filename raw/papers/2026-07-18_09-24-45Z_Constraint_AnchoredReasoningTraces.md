# Constraint-Anchored Reasoning Traces

## Abstract
Autoregressive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer from error snowballing: a single incorrect inference early in a chainof-thought (CoT) trace corrupts all downstream reasoning. We find that in state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs, once the first error occurs, the reasoning cascades into failure across all remaining steps in 65% of such cases (a metric we term the snowball rate). Existing mitigations-sampling multiple chains, post-hoc self-verification, or full program synthesis-either lack symbolic grounding, catch errors too late, or sacrifice the flexibility of natural language reasoning. We propose Constraint-Anchored Reasoning Traces (CART), a neuro-symbolic framework that trains MLLMs to interleave natural language reasoning steps with symbolic constraint assertions: lightweight, machine-checkable statements about visual content (e.g., count(red_objects) = 3). A dual-pronged Constraint Propagation Module-combining a learned neural grounding head with Boolean Constraint Propagation-continuously verifies these anchors against extracted visual features and checks their mutual logical consistency. When a contradiction is detected, a backtrack controller halts generation and reverts to the last consistent checkpoint, preventing error propagation. A variable-frequency emission mechanism allows the model to adaptively control anchor density, avoiding trace bloat. We construct 218K training instances by augmenting GQA, CLEVR-CoGenT, and VCR with ground-truth constraint annotations derived from scene graphs, and fine-tune open-source MLLMs (LLaVA-NeXT, Qwen2-VL) via LoRA. On five benchmarks, CART reduces the snowball rate from 0.65 to 0.14, improves GQA accuracy by +4.6 percentage points over trainingonly baselines, and achieves 89.1 F1 on POPE-all with at most 18% inference overhead.
