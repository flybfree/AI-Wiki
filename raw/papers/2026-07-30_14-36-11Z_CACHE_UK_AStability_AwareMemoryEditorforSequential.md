# CACHE-UK: A Stability-Aware Memory Editor for Sequentially Updated Quantized LLMs in Finance

## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in dynamic financial environments face a critical challenge: maintaining factual accuracy as market conditions, regulations, and corporate facts change continuously. While 4-bit quantization enables efficient deployment, it severely limits the viability of sequential memory editing: existing methods undergo catastrophic performance degradation under this "quantization stability crisis." We introduce CACHE-UK (Contextual Adaptive Continual Hybrid Editor for UK Finance), a stability-aware memory editing framework specifically designed for domain-specific, quantized LLMs. CACHE-UK integrates three components: a rank-1 LoRA perturbation mechanism that confines edits to the low-rank adapter subspace, a financial domain prioritization module for content-adaptive edit strength, and a closed-loop Stability Controller that tracks "degradation debt" to prevent catastrophic forgetting across sequential updates. Evaluated on a 4-bit quantized OpenLLaMA-3B model with a curated UK financial corpus of 88,021 documents, CACHE-UK reduces knowledge degradation by 11-17% relative to adapted baselines under identical 4-bit constraints -- its most robust effect -- while attaining the highest test success (generalization) rate observed in our setting (28%, a 6 percentage point improvement over the strongest adapted baseline). These results indicate that stability-aware editing can improve factual maintenance in resource-constrained financial LLM deployments, though absolute generalization rates remain low.
