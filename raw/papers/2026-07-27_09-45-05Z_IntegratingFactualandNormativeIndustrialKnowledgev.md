# Integrating Factual and Normative Industrial Knowledge via Constraint-Aware Graph Attention for Process Plan Recommendation

## Abstract
Integrating heterogeneous industrial knowledge, including factual relations and decision constraints, remains a core challenge in industrial information systems. Machining process planning exemplifies this problem because engineers must select operations by combining material properties, feature characteristics, and quality requirements. Existing methods rely mainly on similarity retrieval or classification, without a unified ranking objective or standardized evaluation. We propose PCA-GAT, which formulates machining process plan recommendation as a knowledge graph enhanced collaborative filtering problem. Bayesian Personalized Ranking provides the learning objective, while Recall@K and NDCG@K define evaluation. The knowledge graph supplies semantic structure when collaborative signals are sparse. Four domain constraints, material compatibility, precision requirements, feature applicability, and operation sequencing, are introduced as attention biases during graph propagation. Type-specific weights learn their importance, and an adaptive gate adjusts their influence using local context. On a real aerospace dataset with 115 parts and 507 plans, PCA-GAT achieves Recall@1 = 0.9087 and strong cold-start robustness, with about half the degradation of the strongest baseline under severe sparsity. Ablation studies show that knowledge graph enrichment is essential, constraints add value, and ungated constraint injection can hurt performance. The learned weights identify material-operation compatibility as the dominant factor, consistent with domain expertise. Results on three public benchmarks show no degradation when constraints are absent, supporting generalization beyond manufacturing. This study establishes a standardized recommendation protocol for engineering process planning and benchmarks seven methods across three categories, showing that knowledge representation is the main bottleneck.
