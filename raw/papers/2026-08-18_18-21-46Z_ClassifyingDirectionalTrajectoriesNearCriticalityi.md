# Classifying Directional Trajectories Near Criticality in the Three-State Majority-Vote Model with Deep Belief Networks and Bidirectional GRUs

## Abstract
In this work, we investigate whether the latent representations learned by a Deep Belief Network (DBN) and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) can discriminate among four dynamically distinct trajectory types in the three-state majority vote model (MV3): approach from disorder, approach from order, departure to disorder, and departure to order. The DBN, pre-trained in an unsupervised manner on static equilibrium samples via a Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine input layer and architecture $784 \to 4096 \to 225 \to 81$, encodes each lattice snapshot into an 81-dimensional latent vector. A t-SNE analysis of the DBN latent space reveals only partial separation of the four trajectory types, reflecting the fact that a model trained on static configurations cannot fully resolve directional temporal structure. A two-layer Bi-GRU classifier, trained on sequences of DBN-encoded snapshots of length $T = 50$, achieves near-perfect separation of all four trajectory types in its hidden state space, as confirmed by t-SNE visualization on both training and test sets. Furthermore, a sliding-window application of the trained Bi-GRU to continuous MV3 dynamics demonstrates its ability to sense the system's current dynamical regime in real-time. These results establish a principled hierarchical architecture for detecting and classifying critical transitions in agent-based opinion dynamics models.
