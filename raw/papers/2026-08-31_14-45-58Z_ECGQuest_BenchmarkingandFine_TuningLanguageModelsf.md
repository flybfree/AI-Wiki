# ECGQuest: Benchmarking and Fine-Tuning Language Models for Electrocardiography

## Abstract
Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation requires knowledge of cardiology, electrophysiology, clinical diagnosis, ECG waveforms, signal acquisition, and instrumentation. Existing language-model benchmarks, however, primarily assess broad medical knowledge or interpretation of individual ECG signals and images rather than the broader contextual knowledge required for ECG interpretation. We developed ECGQuest, a literature-grounded resource for evaluating and fine-tuning ECG-specific language models. A GPT-4o-based pipeline generated questions from 23 ECG references and Computing in Cardiology proceedings from 2003-2025. The final dataset contains 10,904 unique True/False questions paired with their negated forms (21,808 Q&A pairs). We evaluated three commercial and 20 open-source language models on a held-out test set in a zero-shot setting. Five open-source models with 7-14B parameters were fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation, with BERT and BiomedBERT included as supervised encoder baselines. Generalization was assessed on ECG-related subsets of MedMCQA and MedQA converted to binary True/False questions using official answer keys. Zero-shot accuracy on ECGQuest ranged from 49.5% to 74.4%, with GPT-5 performing best. General-purpose models outperformed medically specialized models, several models showed strong True/False bias, and encoder baselines performed near chance. Fine-tuning improved all open-source models by 6.5-14.1%. Fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B reached 76.3% accuracy, while a five-model voting ensemble reached 78.5%. On MedMCQA and MedQA, fine-tuning mainly benefited weaker or class-biased models and did not consistently improve strong base models. ECGQuest provides a reproducible benchmark for contextual ECG knowledge and shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning can make smaller language models competitive with substantially larger commercial models.
