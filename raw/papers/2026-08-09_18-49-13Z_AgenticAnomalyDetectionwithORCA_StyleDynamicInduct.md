# Agentic Anomaly Detection with ORCA-Style Dynamic Inductive Bias Adaptation in Multimodal Wearable Time Series Data

## Abstract
Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) generate multivariate physiological time series that are highly nonstationary and must often be processed under strict computational and memory constraints. A critical yet underexplored challenge in this setting is selecting an appropriate temporal receptive field, which serves as a strong inductive bias for anomaly detection models. Existing approaches typically rely on fixed temporal contexts, which can perform inconsistently across heterogeneous signal regimes and require dataset-specific tuning. We propose ORCA, an agentically controlled anomaly detection framework that dynamically adapts the temporal receptive field at inference time based on lightweight signal statistics. Rather than introducing additional trainable parameters or learned policies, ORCA employs a supervisory controller that autonomously selects among discrete temporal contexts, enabling state-dependent inductive bias adaptation without retraining. Across a custom WBAN dataset, ORCA achieves performance comparable to the strongest fixed-context baselines (AUROC = 0.99) while eliminating the need to tune temporal horizons in advance. We further evaluate ORCA on MIMIC-IV as a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark, observing conservative generalization behavior without performance collapse under heterogeneous clinical conditions. These results highlight adaptive temporal inductive bias control as a practical and robust design principle for anomaly detection in resource-constrained, nonstationary physiological time series.
