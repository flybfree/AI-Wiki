# ExTernD: Expanded-Rank Ternary Decomposition Ternary LLM PTQ with Accuracy Approaching Any Quantization Level

## Abstract
We introduce ExTernD (Expanded-rank Ternary Decomposition), a post-training factorization of each LLM weight matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ into $A \approx B \mathrm{diag}(D) C$ with ternary factors $B \in \{-1,0,+1\}^{m \times k}$, $C \in \{-1,0,+1\}^{k \times n}$ and a real scale vector $D \in \mathbb{R}^k$. The inner rank $k = μ\min(m,n)$ is deliberately expanded beyond full rank ($μ> 1$), so that components past full rank correct the quantization error of earlier ones. We prove the residual decreases monotonically in $k$ and can be driven below any $\varepsilon > 0$: ExTernD approaches bf16 accuracy arbitrarily closely, which no ternary scheme with a fixed plane count can do. Memory and compute scale continuously with $μ$, and factor sparsity continuously with a threshold $τ$, so an accuracy target is hit exactly rather than rounded to the next bit-width. ExTernD matches Q4_K's per-matrix accuracy at 5.2-5.5 effective bpw (5.1-5.5 with importance weighting) on Gemma-4-E2B and Qwen3.5-4B, and a full Qwen3.5-4B conversion at $μ= 3$ reaches 10.10 wikitext-2 perplexity against 9.78 for bf16 (+3.2%), placing it near the Q4_K/Q5_K accuracy band at ~5.7 effective bpw.
