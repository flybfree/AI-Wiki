# RotaryQuant: Fitting 120B MoE Models on Consumer Hardware via Fused Compressed-Space Attention

## Abstract
Large mixture-of-experts (MoE) language models with 26--120 billion parameters exceed the memory capacity of consumer devices through three simultaneous pressures: resident weight matrices, key-value (KV) cache state that grows linearly with context, and dozens of expert sublayers that must be paged on demand. We present RotaryQuant, a three-axis compression system that addresses all three. Mixed-precision weight quantization assigns bit-widths by architectural role: 4-bit for dense layers, 2-bit for routed experts, and 8-bit for the shared expert whose high activation kurtosis resists aggressive compression. LRU expert offloading pages non-resident experts to disk under genuine memory pressure. The novel axis is IsoQuant, a KV cache compression method that applies a Walsh--Hadamard transform followed by block-diagonal SO(4) rotations to isotropize activation distributions before 3-bit scalar quantization, requiring $O(d \log d)$ operations and 256 stored parameters per head versus $O(d^2)$ and 16{,}384 for dense rotation methods. A fused four-kernel Metal GPU pipeline performs attention directly on packed 3-bit tensors without materializing full-precision KV state---a different execution model, not just a quantization scheme. The combined system fits Gemma 4-26B-A4B and Qwen3-30B-A3B within a 16\,GB budget and Nemotron-H 120B within 32\,GB, running interactively at 9--19 tok/s with near-zero perplexity degradation ($Δ$PPL $\leq +0.0012$) and 100\% retrieval accuracy at 32K context.
