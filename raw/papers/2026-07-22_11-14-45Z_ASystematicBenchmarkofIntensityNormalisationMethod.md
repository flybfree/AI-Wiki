# A Systematic Benchmark of Intensity Normalisation Methods for 3D Knee MRI Segmentation and Cross-Domain Generalisability

## Abstract
Robust out-of-the-box performance is essential for the clinical deployment of deep learning models in medical imaging. An important but underexplored factor affecting model generalisability is intensity normalisation, particularly for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image intensities vary across scanners and protocols. In this study, we systematically compared seven normalisation methods and their impact on the performance of a 3D U-Net model for meniscus segmentation from knee MRI. The methods included standard scaling approaches, histogram-based techniques, and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based method. Models were trained on the IWOAI 2019 dataset and evaluated on both internal and external test sets (SKM-TEA) to assess generalisability. Performance was similar internally but differences were significant on external data, with Z-score, Nyúl histogram matching, and CLAHE showing greater robustness than other methods. However, these differences were small compared to the significant performance drop observed between datasets. Overall, while intensity normalisation had a measurable effect on model generalisability, its impact was limited relative to the effects of domain shift, highlighting the need for complementary strategies for robust deployment.
