# Satellite Trajectory Optimization via Proximal Policy Optimization for Space Debris Avoidance

## Abstract
Collision avoidance systems are commonly used to avoid fragmentation events occurring in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) and Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (GEO). However, these events have been growing in frequency as orbital congestion worsens with the launch of megaconstellations. Consequently, conjunction alerts and collision risks are becoming increasingly common. Current practices, which are commonly manual or rule-based, have difficulty scaling to these worsening dynamic environments. To address this intensifying situation, we propose a reinforcement-learning policy for autonomous collision avoidance, trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) along with an open-source, high-fidelity astrodynamics simulator for training and evaluation. In 1,000 deterministic GEO episodes, our agent achieves a 97.5% collision avoidance success rate, outperforming traditional controllers such as a rule-based baseline (20.7% success) and an impulsive delta-v planner baseline (27.5% success). To achieve these results, we designed a simulator to train and evaluate our agent, using real-world and simulated debris. We simulate Newtonian two-body dynamics using Sun/Moon third-body perturbations, fuel-dependent thrust, and configurable debris fields. The agent is trained with curriculum learning and shaped rewards oriented toward encouraging survival, adequate projected miss distance, and delta-v conservation. Finally, our evaluation consisted of a fully deterministic pipeline, including shared seeds, per-episode logs, and telemetry exports.
