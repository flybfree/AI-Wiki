# VIBE: A VAD-Informed Benchmark for Entity-Centered Affective Profiling of Large Language Model Outputs

## Abstract
Large language models routinely describe socially salient targets, including political figures, countries, religions, organizations, historical events, and social groups, encoding affective framing alongside factual content: a target may appear favorable or threatening, calm or conflictual, powerful or vulnerable. Existing work captures parts of this space through sentiment, favorability, and emotion benchmarks, but none combines target-directed VAD attribution, an explicit scorer contract, and a passport reporting format. We introduce VIBE, a benchmark for entity-centered affective profiling of LLM outputs in Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space. Its core contribution is a measurement contract: VIBE separates generation from external scoring, distinguishes scalar favorability, response-level VAD, and target-directed VAD, and reports profiles through an Affective Passport. Three empirical layers support the contract. H1 shows scalar favorability does not subsume arousal and dominance: valence findings are cross-validated (rV = 0.944 judge-human, rV = 0.954 inter-scorer); arousal and dominance are single-scorer directional estimates, not point-precise, consistent with known inter-annotator difficulty on these axes (rA = 0.495, rD = 0.702 among human annotators). H2 shows whole-response and target-directed VAD are different contracts: the same text can carry one affective tone overall while representing the named target differently. H3 is a protocol-drift diagnostic: elicitation conditions shift profiles, motivating context metadata in every affective report. These results motivate entity-centered affective profiling as a documented practice: profiles should be released with scorer identity, coverage, protocol, and interpretation limits.
