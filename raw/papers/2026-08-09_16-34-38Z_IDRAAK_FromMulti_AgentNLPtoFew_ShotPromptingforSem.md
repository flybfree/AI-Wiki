# IDRAAK: From Multi-Agent NLP to Few-Shot Prompting for Semantic Drift Detection in Technical Requirements

## Abstract
Translating technical requirements across languages can introduce semantic drift, altering numerical constraints, polarities, modalities, or other specification-critical meaning. IDRAAK is presented as an interpretable framework for detecting such drift using a language-independent Semantic Requirement Representation (SRR), with six detection workflows evaluated, ranging from deterministic comparison to multi-agent verification and few-shot prompting. On 890 synthetic perturbations across 300 requirements from 10 engineering domains, a single LLM call with six few-shot examples achieves MCC=0.888 and F1=0.983, outperforming the evaluated structured and multi-stage alternatives. Further evaluation on PAWS-X (805 pairs, 5 languages) and XNLI (700 pairs, 7 languages) exposes complementary strengths and limitations of structured and LLM-based approaches. Deterministic SRR comparison performs strongly on technical requirements (F1=0.898) but poorly on general-domain text (F1=0.012), while structured evidence improves performance on adversarial paraphrases. Post-hoc Platt scaling further improves confidence calibration. The results demonstrate that increased agentic complexity does not necessarily improve semantic-drift detection and that simple few-shot prompting can provide a strong and efficient alternative.
