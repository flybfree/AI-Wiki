# 4DStreamCtrl: Interactive Video Generation with Online 4D Control

## Abstract
Generative video models now synthesize footage nearly indistinguishable from reality. Their promise as interactive tools hinges on fine-grained control of how objects and the camera move over time, yet each existing approach captures only part of this: camera-parameter methods steer the viewpoint but cannot move objects, 2D-trajectory methods act in the image plane and ignore depth and occlusion, and recent 3D methods add geometry but run only offline at a fixed length. In particular, none combines 3D-consistent control of both camera and objects with real-time, streaming generation. Here we show that camera motion, object trajectories, and depth can be unified into a single 3D point-track representation, from which one model performs joint camera and object control, depth editing, and motion transfer in a single forward pass. To learn this interface at scale, we mine in-the-wild video for 3D motion supervision, yielding OpenVidHD-Motion3D, and encode it with a lightweight Geometric Motion Head that plugs into a pretrained video diffusion model. Because this encoder is temporally separable, we distill the model into a causal streaming student that generates arbitrarily long video in four denoising steps at memory independent of length. This unified design surpasses prior camera-only, 2D, and offline-3D methods in motion-control precision while covering modalities they address only in isolation. 4DStreamCtrl runs at 20 FPS on a single high-end GPU for 480p video and stays temporally coherent over hundreds of frames, enabling, to our knowledge, interactive 4D-controllable streaming generation for the first time. More broadly, grounding generation in explicit 3D geometry with efficient causal inference points toward interactive world models with closed-loop spatiotemporal control, from controllable simulators to real-time visual imagination for embodied agents.
