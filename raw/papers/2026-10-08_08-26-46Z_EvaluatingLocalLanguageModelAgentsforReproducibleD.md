# Evaluating Local Language Model Agents for Reproducible Data Engineering: An Empirical Software Engineering Study of Mobility Workflows

## Abstract
Context: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly used as software and data-engineering assistants, yet evidence about locally deployable open-weight agents remains limited. Existing evaluations often emphasize textual responses or isolated code generation rather than the validity of complete engineering artifacts.   Objectives: We evaluate whether local LLM agents can produce correct and reproducible data-engineering artifacts, quantify the effect of a closed-loop workspace condition, and examine trade-offs in model scale, architecture, quantization, runtime, tool use, and failure.   Methods: We introduce a benchmark of fifteen mobility-workflow tasks covering data discovery, connectors, transport-feed processing, semantic enrichment, feature engineering, validation, visualization, and reporting. Deterministic checkers assess generated scripts, tables, structured files, figures, and reports. Ten local configurations are evaluated in one-shot and closed-loop conditions, with five repetitions per model, mode, and task, yielding 1,500 scored attempts on a consumer-grade GPU.   Results: Among models larger than two billion parameters, the workspace condition increases pass rates by 26.7-52.0 percentage points over one-shot generation. The strongest configuration reaches 85.3% artifact-level success, and a quantized 9-billion-parameter model reaches 69.3% with an approximately 6.5 GB memory footprint. Gains are largest when intermediate artifacts expose errors the agent can inspect and repair.   Conclusion: Local open-weight agents can support a meaningful subset of software-intensive data-engineering work, but reliability depends on model capability, task verifiability, and deterministic validation. The benchmark provides a reproducible method for evaluating complete agent configurations before adoption in engineering workflows.
