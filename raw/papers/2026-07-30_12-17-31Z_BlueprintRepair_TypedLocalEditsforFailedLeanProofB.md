# BlueprintRepair: Typed Local Edits for Failed Lean Proof Blueprints

## Abstract
LLM-based Lean proving systems increasingly organize a proof as a blueprint: a dependency graph of formal statements. We introduce BlueprintRepair, a repair interface that lets a model change this graph through ten schema-checked local operations. An operation names the node it edits, so the target theorem cannot be changed. Lean checks every applied change, and an accepted repair must declare every blueprint lemma its proof uses. We also construct BlueprintTrace, a benchmark of 142 controlled failures with complete accepted and rejected repair trajectories. We compare typed edits, exact source patches, and complete module rewrites under matched source, feedback, model, and budget, one episode per state and interface. With DeepSeek-V4-Flash, the three interfaces solve almost the same number of the benchmark's localized failures. Typed repair is the cheapest per solved state (patching is 1.30x as expensive, rewriting 2.06x), and within 10,000 completion tokens per task it reaches almost all of its final coverage, while both free-form interfaces are well behind. A second model, Qwen3.6-Flash, solves fewer states but keeps typed repair cheapest, puts it ahead on the proof-authoring states, and repeats the localized pattern.
