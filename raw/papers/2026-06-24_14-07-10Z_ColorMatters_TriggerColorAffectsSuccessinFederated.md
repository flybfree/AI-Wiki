# Color Matters: Trigger Color Affects Success in Federated Backdoor Attacks

## Abstract
Federated learning is vulnerable to backdoor attacks in which malicious clients inject poisoned updates while preserving benign-task performance. In this paper, we study a semantics-driven backdoor mechanism in which attackers use natural visual accessories as triggers and manipulate only the trigger color while keeping the attack pipeline fixed. Our framework considers semantic trigger objects such as masks and sunglasses, instantiated in black and white variants, and evaluates their effect in a controlled federated learning setting. Malicious clients construct poisoned samples by applying a trigger to source-class images and relabeling them to an attacker-chosen target class, while benign clients train only on clean data. We analyze this mechanism under both a standard poisoning objective and a stronger SABLE-based objective that combines clean classification loss, triggered target loss, feature-separation loss in the penultimate representation space, and regularization to keep malicious updates close to the global model. This design enables the attack to remain effective while reducing excessive update drift. Experiments on a four-class CelebA hair-color task show that trigger color significantly changes attack success rate even when trigger semantics, placement, and poisoning budget are unchanged. White triggers are more effective for attacks targeting the blond class, whereas black triggers perform better for attacks targeting the black class. The same trend persists under robust aggregation, showing that trigger color is a meaningful factor in the operation, persistence, and evaluation of semantic backdoor mechanisms in federated learning.
