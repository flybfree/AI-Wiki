# Three Necessary Principles for Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning

## Abstract
We argue that learning visual representations without labels requires a training signal jointly complete across three non-overlapping objectives: semantic invariance across augmented views, patch-level spatial prediction, and representational non-degeneracy. We formalize these as the observation, prediction, and regularization principles and prove (i) that combining observation and prediction without regularization admits the constant encoder as a global minimizer under negative-free alignment; (ii) that the two objectives are gradient-complementary and structurally non-conflicting at the encoder output; and (iii) that the momentum encoder converges to the same fixed point as the online encoder and provides no collapse guarantee at convergence. Contrastive alignment provides only self-limiting collapse resistance, formalized via an explicit gradient-decay argument. Dropping prediction withholds the spatial training signal by construction; dropping observation forfeits cross-view semantic invariance by construction; at the scale we study, no pair substitutes for the third. Every major self-supervised method is a special case of a single unified energy decomposition. We pair every theoretical claim with a controlled experiment, including a patch-retrieval evaluation for the spatial consequence of prediction.
