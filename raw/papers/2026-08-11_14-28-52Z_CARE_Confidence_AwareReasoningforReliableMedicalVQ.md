# CARE: Confidence-Aware Reasoning for Reliable Medical VQA

## Abstract
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) has enabled medical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for visual question answering, yet these models suffer from $\textit{confidence miscalibration}$---a systematic gap between expressed certainty and actual diagnostic accuracy that undermines clinical trust. We propose $\textbf{CARE}$, a $\textbf{C}$onfidence-$\textbf{A}$ware medical $\textbf{RE}$asoning framework that jointly optimizes accuracy and calibration through a dual-stage pipeline. First, a scalable Medical-CoT synthesis provides structured cold-start data for Supervised Fine-Tuning. Second, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel $\textbf{Confidence-Aware Reward (CAR)}$ mechanism ties the model's confidence to diagnostic correctness within the reward signal. Across three Medical VQA benchmarks, $\textbf{CARE}$ achieves the highest diagnostic accuracy while obtaining the lowest Expected Calibration Error and Hallucination Rate, establishing a foundation for trustworthy clinical decision support.
