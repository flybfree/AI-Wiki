# Bridging the Gap Between Semantics and Reconstruction:Unifying Sign Language Translation and Production

## Abstract
Recent advances in sign language (SL) research have shown a trend toward unifying multiple sign language understanding (SLU) subtasks, such as isolated sign language recognition (ISLR), continuous sign language recognition (CSLR), and sign language translation (SLT), within a single framework, leading to substantial progress. Meanwhile, sign language production (SLP), which generates sign sequences from text, has also attracted growing attention. This naturally raises an important question: can sign language understanding and production be unified within a single framework? Compared with unifying SLU subtasks, this problem is substantially more challenging. Existing SLU tasks largely share the same direction of mapping, namely from sign inputs to linguistic outputs, whereas SLT and SLP lie in opposite directions of sign-text mapping. A unified framework must therefore address two key challenges: (1) bridging the modality gap between continuous sign motions and discrete text tokens through a shared sign tokenizer that supports both linguistic abstraction and motion reconstruction; and (2) learning a single conditional autoregressive model that can take either sign or text as input and generate the corresponding target sequence in the opposite modality. To this end, we propose Uni-SLTP, a unified framework for SLT and SLP with two key components: (1) a shared sign tokenizer that converts sign sequences into discrete tokens and latent representations, capturing both semantic and reconstructive information; and (2) a unified autoregressive generation model that formulates both tasks as conditional sequence generation. Experiments on widely used public datasets show that Uni-SLTP achieves superior motion accuracy for SLP while maintaining competitive SLT performance.
