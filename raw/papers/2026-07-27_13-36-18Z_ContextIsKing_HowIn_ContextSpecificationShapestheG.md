# Context Is King: How In-Context Specification Shapes the Geometry of Concepts

## Abstract
Large language models place structured concepts on geometrically faithful manifolds: weekdays lie on a circle, months on another, usually taken to be a fixed world-model the network stores and looks up. We show that context is king: the structure a model actually uses is set by the in-context specification. A declarative rule fixes not only which relations the geometry encodes but its topology type: the same tokens form a cycle or a branching tree on command, built even on arbitrary, meaning-free tokens with no prior to inherit, which a relabeled stored shape cannot do. When the specification conflicts with a strong pretrained prior, the context-set geometry dominates it in capable models, read from the same activations (representational similarity 0.6--0.9 to the imposed structure versus near-zero to the prior), across the priors we test and both families we study (Gemma, Qwen). Activation patching shows the map is causally used, not a probe correlate: swapping one entity's activation for another's makes the model answer with the other entity's successor under the imposed order. A rough map forms readily, present even in small and base models; what scale gates is using it cleanly: clean dominance and the causal crossover emerge only in the larger models (up to Gemma-31B and Qwen-27B) and weaken or reverse below, so a mechanism present in a large model can be absent in a smaller one of the same family. Whether the model builds this geometry anew or reconfigures a stored one we leave open; operationally, the geometry it uses is the one the context specifies.
