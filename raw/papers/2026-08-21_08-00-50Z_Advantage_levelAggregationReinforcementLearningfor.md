# Advantage-level Aggregation Reinforcement Learning for X-point Target Magnetic Configuration Control in an EXL-50U Experiment-Calibrated Simulation Environment

## Abstract
Managing divertor heat loads is a central challenge for compact, high-power tokamaks. To increase local flux expansion and decouple the dissipation volume from the core, EHL-2 adopts the X-point target (XPT) divertor. This requires the secondary X-point to remain on the divertor leg; displacement degrades the topology and exhaust geometry. Current experiments, including EXL-50U discharges, rely on precomputed feedforward waveforms with PID loops on global quantities. Lacking dedicated closed-loop feedback for the secondary null, XPT operation is repeatable but not routine. We formulate XPT feedback as a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) control problem in a free-boundary environment calibrated to EXL-50U discharge #13906. To address strong coupling among plasma current, shape, and null constraints - where reward scalarisation collapses objective-specific temporal credit - we develop Advantage Aggregation (AdvA). AdvA preserves objective-wise temporal credit before worst-objective-aware nonlinear scalarisation and introduces a residual correction to policy updates. AdvA-PPO is evaluated against Reward-PPO and a feedforward-plus-PID baseline under nominal operation, measurement uncertainties, and unseen initial equilibria. On a 500 ms rollout, AdvA-PPO raises the mean worst-channel score from 0.23 to 0.81 over Reward-PPO, reducing X-point flux RMSE by ~20x. Under combined measurement uncertainties, it is the only learned controller completing the horizon while retaining a usable XPT shape. Multi-initialization fine-tuning enables a single AdvA-PPO policy to complete full-horizon operation across divertor and limiter initial equilibria. These results provide a simulation-based foundation for future real-time XPT validation on EXL-50U.
